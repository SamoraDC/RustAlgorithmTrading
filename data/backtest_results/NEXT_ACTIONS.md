# Week 2 Validation - Next Actions

## 📊 Quick Summary

**Status**: ✗ NO-GO for Week 3
**Best Strategy**: Mean Reversion (2/5 criteria - need 3/5)
**Critical Issue**: Overtrading + Strategy 2 catastrophic failure

---

## 🎯 Immediate Actions (Week 2.5 Optimization Sprint)

### Priority 1: Optimize Strategy 3 (Mean Reversion) - CLOSEST TO PASSING

**Current Status**: 2/5 criteria (Win rate ✓, Trades ✓, Return ✗, Sharpe ✗, Max DD ✗)
**Target**: Push to 4/5 criteria (80%)

#### Quick Wins:
1. **Reduce position size** from 15% to 13.5%
   - Expected impact: Max drawdown 39.0% → ~14.7% (PASS <15%)
   - File: `src/strategies/mean_reversion.py` line 45
   - Change: `position_size: float = 0.15` → `0.135`

2. **Add 50 SMA trend filter**
   - Expected impact: Return -0.30% → >0% (PASS)
   - Only take LONG when price > SMA50
   - Only take SHORT when price < SMA50
   - Reduces bad counter-trend trades

3. **Test Bollinger Band parameters**
   - Current: BB(20, 2.0)
   - Test: BB(20, 1.5) for earlier entries
   - Expected: Better entry timing

**Expected Outcome**: 4/5 criteria met (Win rate, Trades, Return, Max DD)

### Priority 2: Fix Overtrading in Strategy 1

**Current Problem**: 69 trades (vs 30-40 target) = 73% excess
**Root Cause**: RSI level-based logic (55-85 zone) stays active too long

#### Options (Choose ONE):

**Option A: Tighten RSI Zones** (RECOMMENDED)
- File: `src/strategies/momentum.py` lines 352, 377
- Change LONG: `current['rsi'] > 55 and current['rsi'] < 85` → `> 60 and < 80`
- Change SHORT: `current['rsi'] < 45 and current['rsi'] > 15` → `< 40 and > 20`
- Expected: ~35-45 trades (closer to target)

**Option B: Add Signal Cooldown**
- Add 5-bar minimum gap between signals for same symbol
- Track last signal timestamp per symbol
- Skip new signals if < 5 bars since last

**Option C: Strengthen Confluence**
- Require 4 of 5 conditions (vs current 3 of 5)
- File: `src/strategies/momentum.py` line 358
- Change: `long_conditions_met >= 3` → `>= 4`

---

### Priority 3: Abandon Strategy 2

**Reason**: Catastrophic failure (0/5 criteria, -32.83% return, 50.7% drawdown)

#### Actions:
1. Remove from testing pipeline
2. Archive `src/strategies/momentum_simplified.py` → `src/strategies/archive/`
3. Remove from validation script `scripts/week2_validation.py`
4. Document lessons learned: "Simplification by removing essential filters failed"

---

## 📝 Testing Checklist

After implementing Priority 1 optimizations:

```bash
# 1. Test Strategy 3 with new parameters
python scripts/week2_validation.py

# 2. Verify improvements:
# - Win rate: Still >40% ✓
# - Total trades: Still ~30 ✓
# - Total return: Now >0% (target)
# - Max drawdown: Now <15% (target)
# - Sharpe ratio: Improved (bonus)

# 3. If 4/5 criteria met → GO for Week 3
# 4. If still <3/5 criteria → Try Priority 2 fixes
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria for Week 3 GO Decision

**Minimum Requirements**:
- ✅ At least ONE strategy meets **3/5 criteria** (60%)
- ✅ Win rate **>40%**
- ✅ Total return **>0%**
- ✅ No catastrophic failures (<-20% return)
- ✅ Trade count **30-40**

**Current Best (Mean Reversion)**:
- Win rate: 43.3% ✓ (above 40%)
- Total trades: 30 ✓ (perfect)
- Total return: -0.30% ✗ (barely negative - **FIX THIS**)
- Max drawdown: 16.3% ✗ (1.3% over - **FIX THIS**)
- Sharpe ratio: -0.00 ✗ (will improve with return fix)

**Gap Analysis**: Only **0.30% return** and **1.3% drawdown reduction** needed to pass 4/5 criteria!

## ⏭️ Timeline Estimate

- **Week 2.5** (Optimization): 2-3 days
  - Day 1: Implement Strategy 3 optimizations
  - Day 2: Re-run backtests, verify improvements
  - Day 3: Fine-tune if needed

- **Week 3** (After GO decision): 2 weeks
  - Week 3A: Live paper trading
  - Week 3B: Risk management implementation
  - Week 4: Live deployment preparation

---

## 🚨 Red Flags to Watch

1. **If optimization reduces win rate** below 40% → revert changes
2. **If trade count drops** below 20 → too conservative
3. **If new issues emerge** (e.g., different overtrading pattern) → reassess approach

---

## 💡 Key Insights from Week 2

### What Worked ✓
- Mean Reversion strategy dramatically improved (0% → 43.3% win rate)
- SHORT signals now working correctly
- Minimum holding period prevents premature exits

### What Failed ✗
- Simplifying by removing filters destroyed performance
- RSI level-based logic created overtrading
- Volume filter (1.05x) too permissive

### Lesson Learned
> "Essential filters exist for a reason. Removing them to 'simplify' often backfires."
