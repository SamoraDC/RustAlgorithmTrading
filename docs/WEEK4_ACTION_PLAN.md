# Week 4 Action Plan: Paper Trading & Monitoring

**Date**: 2025-10-29
**Status**: CONDITIONAL - Requires Week 3 Validation Success
**Timeline**: 7 days (Week 4)
**Prepared By**: Documenter Agent (Hive Mind Collective)

---

## Executive Summary

**Prerequisite**: Week 3 validation backtest must show **win rate ≥40%** to proceed

Week 4 transitions from backtesting to **paper trading with live market data**. The focus shifts from implementation to validation, monitoring, and risk management in a real-time environment. This plan provides a structured approach to safely deploying the trading system while maintaining strict risk controls and performance monitoring.

---

## Week 4 Objectives

### Primary Objective
**Deploy to paper trading and validate strategy performance in real-time market conditions**

### Secondary Objectives
1. Establish comprehensive monitoring infrastructure
2. Validate risk management in live environment
3. Identify any backtest-to-live discrepancies
4. Build confidence for eventual live trading deployment
5. Create operational runbook for daily management

### Success Criteria
- Paper trading runs without errors for 7 consecutive days
- Win rate maintains 40-60% (aligned with backtest)
- Daily drawdown <3%
- Max drawdown <10%
- All risk management rules enforced correctly
- Monitoring alerts working properly

## Risk Assessment

### High Probability Risks (>50%)

1. **Backtest-to-Live Performance Divergence** (70% probability)
   - **Issue**: Live performance may differ from backtest by 10-20%
   - **Impact**: Win rate, Sharpe ratio lower than expected
   - **Mitigation**: Accept 10-20% divergence as normal, monitor closely
   - **Contingency**: If >20% divergence, investigate and adjust

2. **Lower Trade Frequency Than Expected** (60% probability)
   - **Issue**: May generate only 5-10 trades vs expected 10-20
   - **Impact**: Insufficient data for statistical significance
   - **Mitigation**: Extend Week 4 to 10-14 days if needed
   - **Contingency**: Consider adding more symbols to increase opportunities

### Medium Probability Risks (25-50%)

3. **Market Regime Change** (40% probability)
   - **Issue**: Market conditions during Week 4 differ from backtest period
   - **Impact**: Strategy performs worse in new regime
   - **Mitigation**: Monitor market regime daily, adjust if needed
   - **Contingency**: Implement regime detection faster (move to Week 4)

4. **Execution Slippage Higher Than Expected** (35% probability)
   - **Issue**: Fill prices worse than backtest assumptions
   - **Impact**: Average trade P&L reduced by 0.2-0.5%
   - **Mitigation**: Use limit orders, adjust assumptions
   - **Contingency**: Factor slippage into Week 5 planning

### Low Probability Risks (<25%)

5. **System Crash or Critical Error** (15% probability)
   - **Issue**: Software bug causes system crash
   - **Impact**: Miss trading opportunities, require manual intervention
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive pre-testing, monitoring, auto-restart
   - **Contingency**: Emergency stop, fix bug, restart

6. **Alpaca API Issues** (10% probability)
   - **Issue**: Alpaca paper trading API downtime
   - **Impact**: Cannot trade during outage
   - **Mitigation**: Monitor Alpaca status, have backup plan
   - **Contingency**: Pause trading, resume when API restored

## Conclusion

Week 4 represents a critical transition from backtesting to live market validation. Success requires:
1. **Robust monitoring infrastructure** - Real-time visibility into system performance
2. **Strict risk management** - Multiple layers of protection against losses
3. **Rapid response to anomalies** - Quick identification and resolution of issues
4. **Comprehensive documentation** - Detailed records for analysis and improvement

**Expected Outcome**: Week 4 successful completion builds confidence for Week 5 live trading deployment

**Contingency Plan**: If Week 4 reveals significant issues, extend paper trading or return to backtesting as needed

**Timeline**: 7 days (extendable to 14 days if needed)

**Success Probability**: 75% (high probability given Week 3 validation success)

**PREREQUISITE**: Week 3 validation must show win rate ≥40% to proceed with Week 4
**NEXT STEP**: Execute Week 3 validation backtest → Analyze results → Make GO/NO-GO decision
