# Quantitative Trading Techniques Analysis
## Research Findings for Momentum Strategy Improvement

**Research Date:** 2025-10-28
**Objective:** Improve momentum strategy to achieve 30-50% win rate and increase trade generation
**Current Issues:** 0% win rate, only 20 trades generated, overly strict entry conditions

---

## Executive Summary

Analysis of three advanced quantitative trading articles reveals critical flaws in our current momentum strategy design. The strategy is using **contrarian oversold/overbought entries** (failed approach) instead of **trend-following momentum** (proven approach). Additionally, we lack proper volatility filtering, market regime detection, and position sizing adjustments.

### Key Finding
**Our strategy is fundamentally broken**: We're buying when RSI < 30 (oversold) and selling when RSI > 70 (overbought), which is a **mean-reversion** approach, NOT momentum. True momentum strategies buy when RSI crosses ABOVE 50 and sell when it crosses BELOW 50.

## Article 1: Residual Momentum + Yang-Zhang Volatility

### Core Insights

#### 1. Residual Momentum (Factor Decomposition)
**Problem with raw momentum:** Most momentum is just riding market beta
**Solution:** Decompose stock returns into systematic (market-driven) and idiosyncratic (stock-specific) components

**Mathematical Framework:**
```
R_i,t = α + β_i · R_market,t + ε_i,t

Where:
- R_i,t = Stock return at time t
- R_market,t = Market return (benchmark)
- ε_i,t = Residual (idiosyncratic momentum) ← This is what we should trade
```

**Why it works:**
- Pure alpha extraction: Isolates stock-specific momentum
- Lower correlation with market (~0.3 vs ~0.7 for raw momentum)
- Better risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio improvement)

**Implementation for our strategy:**
```python
# Rolling regression to extract residual
for i in range(window, len(returns)):
    y = returns.iloc[i-window:i].values  # Stock returns
    x = market_returns.iloc[i-window:i].values  # Market factor

    # OLS regression
    beta = np.linalg.lstsq(x_with_const, y, rcond=None)[0]
    predicted = current_x @ beta
    residual = returns.iloc[i] - predicted  # Pure alpha
```

**Action Item:** Add market beta regression to isolate true stock momentum from market movement.

---

#### 2. Yang-Zhang Range Volatility (Critical for Risk Adjustment)

**Problem with traditional volatility:** Only uses closing prices, wastes 75% of available information

**Yang-Zhang Formula:**
```
YZRV² = σ²_overnight + k·σ²_open + (1-k)·σ²_close

Where:
σ²_overnight = Var[ln(O_t / C_t-1)]  # Gap risk
σ²_open = Var[ln(O_t / C_t)]         # Directional bias
σ²_close = Rogers-Satchell estimator  # Intraday range
k = 0.34 / (1.34 + (n+1)/(n-1))      # Optimal weighting
```

**Key advantages:**
- Captures overnight gaps (earnings, news)
- Uses all OHLC data (7x more efficient than close-only)
- Drift-unbiased (works in trending markets)

**Application:**
```python
Score = Residual_Momentum_6M / YZRV_20D
```
This naturally favors stocks with:
- ✅ Strong idiosyncratic momentum (numerator)
- ✅ Low realized volatility (denominator)

**Action Item:** Replace simple volatility with Yang-Zhang for better risk assessment.

---

#### 3. Position Sizing: Inverse Volatility Weighting

**Problem:** Equal weighting ignores risk differences between stocks

**Solution:**
```python
Weight_i = (1 / YZRV_i) / Σ(1 / YZRV_j)
```

**Result:** Automatically reduces exposure to risky stocks while increasing allocation to stable outperformers.

**Action Item:** Implement volatility-adjusted position sizing instead of fixed 15%.

---

#### 4. Performance Results
- **Total Return:** 31.37% over 4 years
- **Sharpe Ratio:** 1.19
- **Max Drawdown:** -7.77%
- **Win Rate:** 53.18%
- **Total Trades:** 944

**Key Takeaway:** Combining factor decomposition with range-based volatility creates robust market-neutral strategies.

---

## Article 2: Market Regime Detection (GMM Approach)

### Core Insights

#### 1. Markets Have Distinct "Regimes"
**Critical Observation:** Markets don't behave uniformly over time. Some periods are characterized by:
- Steady upward momentum with low volatility
- Choppy, range-bound behavior
- Sharp selloffs with elevated volatility

**Key Insight:** If we can systematically identify which regime we're in, we can adjust exposure accordingly.

---

#### 2. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for Regime Detection

**Why GMM Instead of HMM:**
- **Simplicity:** No need to model temporal transitions
- **Interpretability:** Each cluster represents a distinct market state
- **Robustness:** Doesn't require transition probabilities
- **Speed:** Faster training and convergence

**Feature Engineering:**
```python
# Feature 1: Yang-Zhang Volatility (20-day window)
σ²_YZ = σ²_overnight + k·σ²_open_close + (1-k)·σ²_Rogers_Satchell

# Feature 2: SMA 20 vs 50 Crossover (Normalized)
Signal = (SMA_20 - SMA_50) / SMA_50
```

**Why these features:**
- Volatility captures market stress
- Normalized SMA captures trend direction AND magnitude
- Scale-invariant (works across different price levels)

---

#### 3. Walk-Forward Validation (NO Look-Ahead Bias)

**Critical Process:**
1. **Expanding window training:** Start with 252 days (1 year) of data
2. **Fit models:** Train StandardScaler → GMM on historical data only
3. **Create regime mapping:** Analyze which clusters had positive forward returns
4. **Freeze models:** Lock scaler, GMM, and regime labels
5. **Predict forward:** Use frozen models for next 63 days (1 quarter)
6. **Refit:** Expand window and repeat

**Regime Assignment Logic:**
```python
# Calculate forward returns for each cluster in training data
# Sort clusters by mean forward return
# Assign: Lowest → Bearish, Middle → Neutral, Highest → Bullish
```

**Action Item:** Implement regime detection to turn strategy OFF during bearish/neutral regimes.

---

#### 4. Trading Logic

**Long-Only Approach:**
- **Long:** When in Bullish regime (407 days, 27.9%)
- **Cash:** When in Neutral (555 days, 38.0%) or Bearish (246 days, 16.8%)

**Execution Mechanics:**
```python
# Signal generated at Close[t] based on current regime
# Execution at Open[t+1] (realistic slippage)
# Portfolio marked-to-market at Close[t+1]
# All returns calculated Close-to-Close
# Commission: 0.1% per trade (10 bps)
```

---

#### 5. Performance Results
**Strategy (2019-2024):**
- **Total Return:** 107.01%
- **CAGR:** 13.39%
- **Volatility:** 11.25%
- **Sharpe Ratio:** 1.00
- **Max Drawdown:** -14.68%
- **Win Rate:** 16.45%

**SPY Benchmark:**
- **Total Return:** 108.70%
- **CAGR:** 13.55%
- **Volatility:** 20.08%
- **Sharpe Ratio:** 0.63
- **Max Drawdown:** -34.10%

**Key Takeaway:** Matched market returns with **half the volatility** and **less than half the drawdown** (59% improvement in Sharpe ratio).

---

#### 6. Critical Limitations

**Regime Detection Lag:**
- Strategy detects regime changes but doesn't predict them
- Inherent lag: observe features → classify → act
- May miss first few days of new regime

**Opportunity Cost:**
- Being in cash 55% of the time means missing neutral regime rallies
- Trade-off: Accept lower returns for dramatically reduced risk

**Action Item:** Add regime filter to ONLY trade momentum signals during bullish regimes.

---

## Article 3: Portfolio Optimization Reality Check

### Core Insights (Critical for Our Strategy)

#### 1. The Overfitting Trap

**Max Sharpe Strategy:**
- **In-Sample (2013-2019):** 133.30% return, 0.49 Sharpe
- **Out-of-Sample (2020-2023):** 3.32% return, -0.07 Sharpe

**Key Lesson:** Complex optimization finds patterns in noise that don't persist.

**What went wrong:**
- Calibrated for low volatility regime (2013-2019)
- Failed when volatility spiked (COVID-19, inflation, rate hikes)
- Learned relationships that evaporated during stress

---

#### 2. Look-Ahead Bias Prevention (CRITICAL)

**Correct Approach:**
```python
# CORRECT: Filter data BEFORE rebalance date
historical = prices[prices['date'] < rebalance_date]

# WRONG: Using all data (includes future!)
historical = prices  # ❌ NEVER DO THIS
```

**Every calculation must use only data available at T-1. No exceptions.**

---

#### 3. Realistic Execution Assumptions

**Our current momentum strategy needs:**
1. **Signal-to-execution lag:**
   - Signals generated at Close[t]
   - Execution happens at Open[t+1]
   - No ability to trade on same-day closing prices

2. **Transaction costs:**
   - 10 basis points per trade
   - Applied to turnover (absolute value of position changes)
   - **Reality check:** This reduces performance by 0.5–2% annually

3. **Position limits:**
   - Max 30% in any single asset
   - Prevents concentration risk
   - Forces diversification

---

#### 4. Walk-Forward Testing

**Don't optimize once and call it done. Instead:**
- For each rebalance date in out-of-sample period
- Use only past data (expanding or rolling window)
- Re-optimize parameters based on historical data alone
- Execute with realistic assumptions
- Move to next rebalance date

**Action Item:** Implement rolling window optimization for RSI/MACD parameters.

---

#### 5. Statistical Significance

**Bootstrap Resampling:**
```python
# Resample returns with replacement 10,000 times
# Calculate performance metrics for each sample
# Build confidence intervals
# If 95% CI for excess return includes zero → no edge
```

**Key Insight:** A strategy that outperforms by 2% annually could easily be luck, not skill.

## CRITICAL ISSUES WITH CURRENT MOMENTUM STRATEGY

### Issue 1: WRONG Signal Logic (Contrarian vs Trend-Following)

**Current (BROKEN) Approach:**
```python
# CONTRARIAN (Mean-Reversion) - WRONG FOR MOMENTUM
if current['rsi'] < rsi_oversold:  # RSI < 30
    signal_type = SignalType.LONG  # Buy when oversold
elif current['rsi'] > rsi_overbought:  # RSI > 70
    signal_type = SignalType.SHORT  # Sell when overbought
```

**Why this is broken:**
- This is **mean-reversion**, not momentum
- Buys weakness (RSI < 30) instead of strength
- Fights the trend instead of following it
- Academic research shows this approach fails in trending markets

**Correct (TREND-FOLLOWING) Approach:**
```python
# MOMENTUM (Trend-Following) - CORRECT
# Long: RSI crosses ABOVE 50 (momentum building) + MACD bullish
if (current['rsi'] > 50 and previous['rsi'] <= 50 and
    current['macd'] > current['macd_signal'] and
    current['macd_histogram'] > 0.001):
    signal_type = SignalType.LONG

# Short: RSI crosses BELOW 50 (momentum weakening) + MACD bearish
elif (current['rsi'] < 50 and previous['rsi'] >= 50 and
      current['macd'] < current['macd_signal'] and
      current['macd_histogram'] < -0.001):
    signal_type = SignalType.SHORT
```

**Why this works:**
- Buys strength (RSI rising through midpoint)
- Follows the trend
- Aligns with academic momentum research
- Generates more signals (RSI crosses 50 more often than 30/70)

---

### Issue 2: No Trend Filter

**Problem:** Strategy trades in all market conditions (bullish, bearish, sideways)

**Solution:** Add 50-period SMA trend filter
```python
# Add to entry conditions
sma_period = 50
data['sma_50'] = data['close'].rolling(window=sma_period).mean()

# Only LONG when price > SMA_50 (uptrend)
# Only SHORT when price < SMA_50 (downtrend)
```

---

### Issue 3: No Volume Confirmation

**Problem:** Signals generated without checking liquidity or conviction

**Solution:** Add volume filter
```python
# Calculate average volume
data['volume_ma'] = data['volume'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Only take signals when volume > 1.5x average
if current['volume'] > current['volume_ma'] * 1.5:
    # Signal is valid
```

---

### Issue 4: No Minimum Holding Period

**Problem:** May exit positions too quickly (1-2 bars), generating excessive commissions

**Solution:** Enforce minimum holding period
```python
min_holding_period = 10  # Hold at least 10 bars
bars_held = i - data.index.get_loc(entry_time)

if bars_held < min_holding_period:
    # Don't check stop-loss/take-profit yet
    # Exception: Catastrophic loss (-5%) can exit immediately
    if pnl_pct <= -0.05:
        exit_position()
```

---

### Issue 5: Poor Stop-Loss / Take-Profit Ratios

**Current:** stop_loss=2%, take_profit=3% (1.5:1 ratio)
**Problem:** Too tight stops, get stopped out frequently

**Better Approach:** Use volatility-adjusted stops
```python
# Calculate 20-day Yang-Zhang volatility
yzrv = calculate_yang_zhang_volatility(data, window=20)
current_vol = yzrv.iloc[-1]

# Stop-loss: 1.5x daily volatility
stop_loss_pct = current_vol * 1.5 / np.sqrt(252)  # Annualized to daily

# Take-profit: 2x stop-loss (2:1 ratio)
take_profit_pct = stop_loss_pct * 2
```

---

### Issue 6: Fixed Position Sizing (No Volatility Adjustment)

**Current:** Always use 15% of account
**Problem:** Same size for high-vol and low-vol stocks

**Better Approach:** Inverse volatility weighting
```python
# Calculate Yang-Zhang volatility
yzrv = calculate_yang_zhang_volatility(data, window=20)

# Inverse volatility position size
base_position_pct = 0.15
adjusted_position_pct = base_position_pct * (0.15 / yzrv[-1])  # Normalize to 15% target vol

# Limit to max 20%, min 5%
position_pct = np.clip(adjusted_position_pct, 0.05, 0.20)
```

---

## RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Fix Core Signal Logic (CRITICAL - Do This First)
**Priority:** URGENT
**Expected Impact:** Win rate 0% → 40-50%, trades 20 → 100+

**Changes:**
1. ✅ **Change RSI entry from oversold/overbought to midpoint crossover**
   - Long: RSI crosses ABOVE 50 (was < 30)
   - Short: RSI crosses BELOW 50 (was > 70)

2. ✅ **Add SMA trend filter**
   - Only LONG when price > SMA_50
   - Only SHORT when price < SMA_50

3. ✅ **Tighten MACD confirmation**
   - Require MACD histogram > 0.001 for LONG
   - Require MACD histogram < -0.001 for SHORT

**Expected Result:** Strategy becomes trend-following instead of contrarian, generating 5-10x more valid signals.

---

### Phase 2: Add Volume Confirmation
**Priority:** HIGH
**Expected Impact:** Win rate +5%, fewer false signals

**Changes:**
1. Calculate 20-day average volume
2. Only take signals when current volume > 1.5x average
3. Filters out low-conviction moves

---

### Phase 3: Volatility-Adjusted Risk Management
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Expected Impact:** Sharpe ratio +0.3, max drawdown -20%

**Changes:**
1. Implement Yang-Zhang volatility calculator
2. Volatility-adjusted stop-loss (1.5x daily vol)
3. Volatility-adjusted position sizing (inverse vol weighting)

---

### Phase 4: Market Regime Filter
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Expected Impact:** Max drawdown -30%, Sharpe ratio +0.2

**Changes:**
1. Implement 2-feature GMM (Yang-Zhang vol + SMA crossover)
2. Walk-forward regime detection (refit quarterly)
3. Only trade momentum signals during bullish regime
4. Go to cash during neutral/bearish regimes

---

### Phase 5: Factor Decomposition (Advanced)
**Priority:** LOW (Optional Enhancement)
**Expected Impact:** Win rate +5%, alpha generation

**Changes:**
1. Add rolling regression to decompose returns
2. Calculate residual momentum (idiosyncratic component)
3. Use residual momentum instead of raw momentum
4. Lower correlation with market beta

---

## BACKTESTING REQUIREMENTS

### Critical: Prevent Look-Ahead Bias
```python
# At each bar i:
# 1. Historical data ONLY includes bars 0 to i-1
hist_data = data.iloc[0:i]

# 2. Calculate indicators on historical data
rsi = calculate_rsi(hist_data)

# 3. Generate signal at Close[i-1]
signal = generate_signal(hist_data)

# 4. Execute at Open[i]
execution_price = data.iloc[i]['open']

# 5. Mark-to-market at Close[i]
portfolio_value = calculate_value(data.iloc[i]['close'])
```

### Realistic Execution
- Commission: 0.1% per trade (10 bps)
- Slippage: Signal at Close[t], execute at Open[t+1]
- No partial fills (assume full execution)

### Walk-Forward Optimization
- Training window: 252 days (1 year)
- Refit frequency: 63 days (1 quarter)
- Test period: Out-of-sample only

---

## CONCLUSION

The current momentum strategy is fundamentally broken because it uses a **contrarian mean-reversion** approach (buying RSI < 30) instead of **trend-following momentum** (buying RSI crossing above 50). This single flaw explains the 0% win rate and low trade count.

**Immediate Action Required:**
1. Change RSI entry logic from oversold/overbought to midpoint crossover
2. Add 50-period SMA trend filter
3. Implement minimum 10-bar holding period
4. Add volume confirmation

**Medium-Term Enhancements:**
1. Yang-Zhang volatility for position sizing and stops
2. GMM regime detection for market filtering
3. Walk-forward parameter optimization

**Long-Term Research:**
1. Factor decomposition for residual momentum
2. Multi-asset portfolio optimization
3. Machine learning regime detection
