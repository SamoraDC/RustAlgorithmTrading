## TL;DR - Key Strategy Parameters

### Core Indicators

| Indicator | Parameters | Thresholds |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **RSI** | Period: 14 | Oversold: 30*, Overbought: 70* |
| **MACD** | Fast: 12, Slow: 26, Signal: 9 | Histogram > 0 (buy), < 0 (sell) |
| **EMA Trend** | Fast: 20, Slow: 50 | Price must be above/below both |
| **Volume** | SMA: 20 | Must be > 1.2× average |

*Dynamic adjustment based on 20-day volatility

### Signal Quality Filters

✅ **Required for BUY Signal**:
1. RSI > oversold threshold (2-bar confirmation)
2. MACD crosses above signal line + histogram > 0
3. Price > EMA(20) > EMA(50)
4. Volume > 1.2× 20-day average
5. No signal in past 5 bars (cooldown)
6. Confidence score ≥ 0.60

✅ **Required for SELL Signal**:
1. RSI < overbought threshold (2-bar confirmation)
2. MACD crosses below signal line + histogram < 0
3. Price < EMA(20) < EMA(50)
4. Volume > 1.2× 20-day average
5. No signal in past 5 bars (cooldown)
6. Confidence score ≥ 0.60

## Position Sizing - Half-Kelly

### Formula
```python
kelly_fraction = (win_rate × win_loss_ratio - loss_rate) / win_loss_ratio
position_size = min(kelly_fraction × 0.5, 0.15)  # Cap at 15%
shares = int((capital × position_size) / price)
```

### Conservative Starting Values
- **Win Rate**: 60%
- **Avg Win**: +3.5%
- **Avg Loss**: -2.0%
- **Max Position**: 15% of capital

---

## Risk Management

### Stop-Loss Strategy
- **Fixed**: 2.0% below entry
- **Trailing**: 1.5% below highest (activates at +3% profit)

### Take-Profit Tiers
1. **50% at +4%** (secure early gains)
2. **30% at +7%** (capture momentum)
3. **20% at +12%** (let winners run)

### Portfolio Limits
- Max single position: **15%**
- Max total exposure: **90%** (keep 10% cash)
- Max concurrent positions: **3-5**
- Daily loss limit: **-2%**
- Max drawdown: **-20%** (review at -15%)

## Expected Performance (Conservative)

| Metric | Target | Acceptable Range |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Total Signals (1 year) | 10-12 | 8-15 |
| Win Rate | 60% | 55-70% |
| Sharpe Ratio | 1.6 | 1.3-2.5 |
| Max Drawdown | -13% | -10% to -20% |
| Annual Return | 18% | 12-30% |
| Profit Factor | 1.95 | 1.5-3.0 |

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Setup (Week 1)
- [ ] Implement dynamic RSI thresholds (volatility-adaptive)
- [ ] Add 2-bar confirmation for RSI signals
- [ ] Implement MACD histogram filter
- [ ] Add EMA trend filter (20/50)
- [ ] Add volume confirmation logic
- [ ] Implement 5-bar cooldown period

### Phase 2: Risk Management (Week 2)
- [ ] Implement Modified Kelly position sizing
- [ ] Add 2% fixed stop-loss
- [ ] Add 1.5% trailing stop (activates at +3%)
- [ ] Implement tiered take-profit (4%/7%/12%)
- [ ] Add portfolio-level risk limits

### Phase 3: Testing (Week 3)
- [ ] Backtest on 2024 data (249 days)
- [ ] Verify 8-15 signals generated
- [ ] Confirm win rate > 55%
- [ ] Validate Sharpe ratio > 1.3
- [ ] Check max drawdown < 20%

### Phase 4: Deployment (Week 4)
- [ ] Paper trade for 2 weeks minimum
- [ ] Compare paper vs backtest results
- [ ] Start with 5-10% of capital
- [ ] Monitor daily performance
- [ ] Scale up gradually after 1 month of consistent performance

## Code Snippets

### Dynamic RSI Thresholds
```python
volatility_20d = returns.rolling(20).std() * np.sqrt(252)

if volatility_20d > 0.30:      # High volatility
    rsi_oversold, rsi_overbought = 25, 75
elif volatility_20d > 0.20:    # Medium volatility
    rsi_oversold, rsi_overbought = 30, 70
else:                          # Low volatility
    rsi_oversold, rsi_overbought = 35, 65
```

### Signal Confidence Score
```python
def calculate_confidence(rsi, macd_hist, price, ema_20, vol, vol_avg):
    rsi_strength = abs(rsi - 50) / 50
    macd_strength = min(abs(macd_hist) / (price * 0.01), 1.0)
    trend_strength = min(abs(price - ema_20) / ema_20, 0.20) / 0.20
    volume_strength = min(vol / vol_avg, 2.0) / 2.0

    # Weighted average
    return 0.30*rsi_strength + 0.30*macd_strength + 0.25*trend_strength + 0.15*volume_strength
```

### Modified Kelly Position Size
```python
def kelly_position_size(win_rate, avg_win, avg_loss, capital, price):
    loss_rate = 1 - win_rate
    win_loss_ratio = abs(avg_win / avg_loss)
    kelly = (win_rate * win_loss_ratio - loss_rate) / win_loss_ratio
    safe_kelly = min(kelly * 0.5, 0.15)  # Half-Kelly, max 15%
    return int((capital * safe_kelly) / price)
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Don't**:
- Trade without all 4 indicator confirmations
- Use static RSI thresholds (30/70) in all volatility regimes
- Ignore volume confirmation
- Skip the 5-bar cooldown period
- Use full Kelly sizing (too aggressive)
- Trade without stop-losses
- Over-optimize parameters on historical data

✅ **Do**:
- Require multi-factor confirmation
- Adapt RSI thresholds to volatility
- Validate signals with volume
- Enforce cooldown periods
- Use Half-Kelly with 15% cap
- Always use stop-losses
- Test on out-of-sample data

## Next Steps

1. **Read full design document**: `/docs/research/improved-momentum-strategy-design.md`
2. **Review current implementation**: `/src/strategies/momentum.py`
3. **Plan implementation**: Create tasks for each enhancement
4. **Backtest thoroughly**: Use 2023-2024 data with realistic costs
5. **Paper trade first**: Minimum 2 weeks before live capital
