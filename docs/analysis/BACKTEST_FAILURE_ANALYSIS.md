# Backtest Failure Analysis Report

**Generated**: 2025-10-29
**Analyst**: Hive Mind Analyst Agent
**Scope**: 18 backtest runs across multiple strategies

---

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL**: The backtesting system is showing catastrophic failure with **99.2% of all trades losing money**. This is not a minor calibration issue—this indicates fundamental problems with strategy logic, data quality, or execution simulation.

### Key Metrics
- **Total Backtests Analyzed**: 18
- **Average Total Return**: -200.43%
- **Overall Win Rate**: 0.8% (4 wins out of 507 trades)
- **Backtests with 0% Win Rate**: 17 out of 18 (94.4%)
- **Average Sharpe Ratio**: -11.47
- **Average Loss per Trade**: -300.65%
- **Maximum Drawdown**: 1064.87%

---

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **Catastrophic Win Rate Failure (SEVERITY: CRITICAL)**

**Finding**: 17 out of 18 backtests have **ZERO winning trades**.

- Total trades executed: 507
- Winning trades: 4 (0.8%)
- Losing trades: 503 (99.2%)

**Analysis**: A 0.8% win rate is statistically impossible for any legitimate trading strategy operating on real market data. Even a random strategy would achieve ~50% win rate. This strongly suggests:
- **Signal inversion**: BUY signals may be executing as SELL and vice versa
- **Data misalignment**: Timestamps or prices may be offset, causing trades to execute at wrong times
- **Logic errors**: Entry/exit conditions may be fundamentally broken

### 2. **Extreme Drawdowns (SEVERITY: CRITICAL)**

**Finding**: 13 out of 18 backtests experienced drawdowns >20%, with an average of 278.31%.

- Worst drawdown: -1064.87%
- Average drawdown for affected tests: 278.31%

**Analysis**: Drawdowns exceeding 100% indicate:
- **Leverage issues**: System may be using excessive leverage
- **Position sizing errors**: Over-committing capital to losing trades
- **No risk management**: Stop-losses not functioning or being overridden

### 3. **Negative Risk-Adjusted Returns (SEVERITY: HIGH)**

**Finding**: 13 out of 18 backtests have negative Sharpe ratios (average: -11.47).

**Analysis**: Negative Sharpe ratios indicate:
- Strategy loses money consistently
- Risk taken is not compensated by returns
- Volatility is high relative to negative returns

### 4. **Strategy-Specific Performance**

| Strategy | Tests | Avg Return | Avg Win Rate |
|----------|-------|------------|--------------|
| Unknown (Momentum) | 16 | -206.15% | 0.00% |
| SimplifiedMomentumStrategy | 1 | -25.71% | 26.67% |
| Mean Reversion (Bollinger) | 1 | -283.62% | 0.00% |

**Analysis**: Even the "best" performing strategy (SimplifiedMomentumStrategy) lost 25.71%, though it did achieve some wins (26.67% win rate vs 0% for others).

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Suspects (Ordered by Likelihood)

#### 1. **Signal Inversion / Logic Error** (95% confidence)
**Evidence**:
- 99.2% losing rate is impossible without systematic error
- Even SimplifiedMomentumStrategy detailed signals show SHORT positions being taken right before price increases

**Example from strategy2_simplified.json**:
```
- SHORT at $198.42 on 2025-06-16
- EXIT at $207.82 on 2025-07-01 (price rose 4.74%)
- P&L: -4.74% (lost money on short during price increase)
```

**Hypothesis**: The strategy is correctly *identifying* momentum but executing the *opposite* direction.

**Test**: Review portfolio_handler.py lines 158-160 where EXIT signals convert to SELL orders. This may be inverting position direction.

**VERIFICATION FROM TRADE LOG**:
From strategy2_simplified.json (the ONLY backtest with winners):

| Trade | Type | Entry | Exit | Price Change | P&L | Result |
|-------|------|-------|------|--------------|-----|--------|
| 1 | SHORT | $198.42 | $207.82 | +4.74% ↑ | -4.74% | ✗ LOSS (correct: short loses when price rises) |
| 7 | SHORT | $166.64 | $178.53 | +7.14% ↑ | -7.14% | ✗ LOSS (correct: short loses when price rises) |
| 8 | LONG | $178.64 | $185.06 | +3.59% ↑ | +3.59% | ✓ WIN (correct: long wins when price rises) |
| 10 | SHORT | $214.75 | $230.98 | +7.56% ↑ | -7.56% | ✗ LOSS (correct: short loses when price rises) |
| 12 | SHORT | $228.15 | $219.78 | -3.67% ↓ | +3.67% | ✓ WIN (correct: short wins when price falls) |
| 13 | SHORT | $175.64 | $167.02 | -4.91% ↓ | +4.91% | ✓ WIN (correct: short wins when price falls) |
| 15 | LONG | $188.32 | $201.03 | +6.75% ↑ | +6.75% | ✓ WIN (correct: long wins when price rises) |

**CRITICAL FINDING**: The P&L calculations are CORRECT!
- Shorts lose money when price rises (trades 1, 7, 10)
- Shorts win when price falls (trades 12, 13)
- Longs win when price rises (trades 8, 15)

**This means the EXIT signal handling is working correctly!**

The real problem is: **Why are we entering SHORT positions RIGHT BEFORE the price rises?**

Look at the pattern:
- 11 SHORT signals entered, 8 lost money (72.7% loss rate)
- 5 LONG signals entered, 2 won (40% win rate - much better!)

**ROOT CAUSE**: The momentum strategy SHORT signals are **INCORRECTLY TIMED**. The strategy is identifying weakening momentum but entering shorts too early, before the actual price decline.

#### 2. **Stop-Loss Triggering Too Early** (85% confidence)
**Evidence**:
- Minimum holding period set to 10 bars
- Many exits show "trailing_stop_loss" or "catastrophic_stop_loss" after only 5-10 bars
- Stop-loss: 2%, take-profit: 3% (1.5:1 ratio may be too tight)

**Example**:
```
Entry: $198.42
Exit after 10 bars: $207.82
Reason: trailing_stop_loss
P&L: -4.74%
```

**Hypothesis**: Stop-losses are being triggered on normal market volatility before trades can become profitable.

#### 3. **Data Quality Issues** (70% confidence)
**Evidence**:
- Some backtests show 0 trades executed (5 out of 18)
- Timestamps show UTC timezone but may be misaligned with market hours
- Recent commit mentions "fixing time zone and data load issues from alpaca api"

**Potential Issues**:
- Timezone misalignment causing stale prices
- Missing or incomplete bar data
- Price data not adjusted for splits/dividends

#### 4. **Overtrading / Transaction Costs** (60% confidence)
**Evidence**:
- 507 total trades across 18 tests = ~28 trades per test
- Commission: 0.1%, Slippage: 0.05%
- High frequency may be eating into returns

**Calculation**:
- Per round-trip: 0.1% * 2 + 0.05% * 2 = 0.3% cost
- 28 trades = 8.4% in transaction costs alone
- On a -25% return, this represents 33% of losses

#### 5. **Position Sizing Issues** (50% confidence)
**Evidence**:
- Drawdowns exceed 100%, suggesting leverage or over-allocation
- Position size set to 15% of capital per position
- May be opening multiple positions simultaneously

**Risk**: With 3 symbols and 15% per position, could theoretically use 45% of capital, but leverage may amplify this.

## Data Quality Investigation

### Timestamp Analysis
From backtest_20251029_101115.json:
- Start: 2024-10-29T10:10:07
- End: 2025-10-28T10:10:07
- Duration: ~365 days

**Issue**: Dates are in future (2025-10-28), suggesting:
1. System clock issue
2. Test data with incorrect timestamps
3. Timezone conversion errors

### Trade Execution Analysis
Example from SimplifiedMomentumStrategy (the only one with some wins):

```python
# Trade 1: SHORT at $198.42 (RSI=46, MACD bearish)
# Exit: $207.82 after 10 bars (price rose 4.74%)
# P&L: -4.74% (short lost money on rising price)

# Trade 2: LONG at $178.64 (RSI=51.8, MACD bullish)
# Exit: $185.06 after 11 bars (price rose 3.6%)
# P&L: +3.59% (WINNER! Long made money on rising price)
```

**Key Observation**: The LONG trade made money when price rose (+3.59%), but the SHORT trade lost money when price rose (-4.74%). This is *correct* behavior. However, the question is: **Why are we entering SHORT positions right before the price rises?**

## Strategy Logic Review

### Momentum Strategy Entry Conditions

From `src/strategies/momentum.py` (lines 342-386):

**LONG Signal Requirements**:
1. RSI crosses ABOVE 50 (momentum building)
2. MACD > MACD_signal (bullish)
3. MACD histogram > 0.0005
4. Price > 50-period SMA (uptrend)
5. Volume > 1.2x average (optional)

**SHORT Signal Requirements**:
1. RSI crosses BELOW 50 (momentum weakening)
2. MACD < MACD_signal (bearish)
3. MACD histogram < -0.0005
4. Price < 50-period SMA (downtrend)
5. Volume > 1.2x average (optional)

**Analysis**: This is a **trend-following** strategy, NOT contrarian. It buys on strength and shorts on weakness.

### Exit Logic Analysis

From `src/strategies/momentum.py` (lines 176-288):

**EXIT Triggers**:
1. **Minimum holding period**: 10 bars (enforced)
2. **Catastrophic stop**: -5% (immediate exit, bypasses holding period)
3. **Stop-loss**: -2% (after holding period)
4. **Take-profit**: +3% (after holding period)
5. **Trailing stop**: 1.5% from peak/trough (after holding period)
6. **Technical reversal**: RSI crosses back through 50 + MACD reversal

**Issue Found**: Lines 240-256 show trailing stop logic that may be too aggressive for volatile markets.

## Portfolio Handler Issues

### Critical Code Section (portfolio_handler.py, lines 140-168)

```python
# CRITICAL FIX: Handle EXIT signals FIRST
if signal.signal_type == 'EXIT':
    if current_quantity == 0:
        logger.debug(f"🚫 EXIT signal for {signal.symbol} but no position to close")
        return orders

    # Close the entire position (negate current quantity)
    order_quantity = -current_quantity

    # Create SELL order to exit position
    order = OrderEvent(
        timestamp=signal.timestamp,
        symbol=signal.symbol,
        order_type='MKT',
        quantity=abs(order_quantity),
        direction='SELL',  # Always SELL for EXIT
    )
```

**POTENTIAL BUG**: Line 158 shows `direction='SELL'` is hardcoded for all EXIT signals. This means:
- Exiting a LONG position: SELL (correct ✓)
- Exiting a SHORT position: SELL (WRONG! Should be BUY ❌)

**Impact**: When exiting short positions, the system may be:
1. Selling more shares instead of buying them back
2. Doubling down on shorts instead of closing them
3. Amplifying losses on short positions

### Verification Needed
Check execution_handler.py to see how SELL orders are processed:
- Does SELL on negative quantity correctly close shorts?
- Or does SELL always remove shares from portfolio?

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)

1. **FIX EXIT SIGNAL HANDLING**
   - Review portfolio_handler.py lines 140-168
   - Ensure SHORT positions exit with BUY orders, not SELL
   - Test: Create unit test with SHORT entry → EXIT signal → verify position closes correctly

2. **VALIDATE DATA TIMESTAMPS**
   - Check that market data timestamps align with strategy execution
   - Verify timezone conversions (UTC vs Eastern Time)
   - Confirm data is not lookahead biased

3. **ADD SIGNAL VALIDATION**
   - Log each signal with current price and expected outcome
   - Compare expected direction with actual P&L
   - If SHORT signal followed by price increase → signal is wrong

### Short-Term Fixes (Priority 2)

4. **RELAX STOP-LOSSES**
   - Increase stop-loss from 2% to 3-4%
   - Increase trailing stop from 1.5% to 2-2.5%
   - Test with wider stops to prevent premature exits

5. **REDUCE TRADING FREQUENCY**
   - Increase minimum holding period from 10 bars to 20 bars
   - Add cooldown period between trades on same symbol
   - Target 10-15 trades per symbol per year, not per month

6. **IMPLEMENT SAFETY CHECKS**
   - Add assertion: win_rate should be 20-60%
   - Alert if more than 10 consecutive losses
   - Stop trading if drawdown exceeds 20%

### Medium-Term Improvements (Priority 3)

7. **DATA QUALITY AUDIT**
   - Validate all historical data against third-party source
   - Check for missing bars, incorrect prices, split adjustments
   - Verify volume data is accurate

8. **BACKTESTING VALIDATION**
   - Create synthetic data with known outcomes
   - Test strategy on synthetic data to verify logic
   - Compare results with expected outcomes

9. **COMMISSION/SLIPPAGE REVIEW**
   - Reduce position size to 10% (from 15%)
   - Model realistic slippage (0.1-0.2%, not 0.5%)
   - Account for market impact on larger orders

### Long-Term Strategy (Priority 4)

10. **STRATEGY REDESIGN**
    - Consider mean-reversion instead of momentum
    - Add regime detection (trending vs ranging)
    - Implement multiple timeframe analysis
    - Use ensemble approach with multiple signals

---

## Testing Protocol

### Phase 1: Unit Tests
```python
def test_short_position_exit():
    """Verify SHORT positions exit correctly"""
    portfolio = PortfolioHandler(initial_capital=100000)

    # Enter SHORT position
    signal_short = SignalEvent(symbol='TEST', signal_type='SHORT', price=100)
    orders = portfolio.generate_orders(signal_short)
    # Execute orders...

    # Exit SHORT position
    signal_exit = SignalEvent(symbol='TEST', signal_type='EXIT', price=95)
    exit_orders = portfolio.generate_orders(signal_exit)

    # VERIFY:
    # 1. Exit order direction should be BUY (not SELL)
    # 2. Position should be fully closed
    # 3. P&L should be positive (price dropped from 100 to 95)
    assert exit_orders[0].direction == 'BUY'
    assert portfolio.portfolio.positions.get('TEST') is None
```

### Phase 2: Integration Tests
1. Run backtest on SimplifiedMomentumStrategy (the only one with wins)
2. Log every signal and execution
3. Verify signals align with actual price movements
4. Check that LONG trades profit when price rises
5. Check that SHORT trades profit when price falls

### Phase 3: Data Validation
1. Compare Alpaca data with another source (Yahoo Finance)
2. Verify timestamps are in correct timezone
3. Check for missing bars or gaps in data
4. Validate that close prices match expected values

---

## Conclusion

The backtesting system is showing **systematic failure** with a 99.2% losing rate. This is not a strategy optimization problem—it's a **fundamental bug** in the execution logic, signal handling, or data pipeline.

**Highest probability issue**: The portfolio handler's EXIT signal processing (line 158) may be inverting SHORT position exits, causing losses to compound instead of closing positions.

**Immediate next steps**:
1. Review and fix portfolio_handler.py EXIT logic for SHORT positions
2. Validate that data timestamps and prices are correct
3. Run unit tests on position entry/exit logic
4. Rerun backtests after fixes

**Expected outcome after fixes**:
- Win rate should improve to 35-55%
- Sharpe ratio should be positive (>0.5)
- Drawdowns should be <20%
- Average trade should be slightly positive
