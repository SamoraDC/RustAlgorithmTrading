- ✅ System Overhead: <1% CPU, <200MB memory
- ✅ API Latency: <10ms P95
- ⚠️ Test Coverage: 31.8% test-to-source ratio

### 🔍 Bottleneck Analysis Report
**File:** `/docs/analysis/BOTTLENECK_ANALYSIS.md`
**Size:** 15+ pages
**Critical Bottlenecks Identified:**

| # | Issue | Severity | Impact | Solution | ROI |
|---|-------|----------|--------|----------|-----|
| 1 | Single-Threaded DuckDB Writes | 🔴 CRITICAL | HIGH | Batched Write Queue | 5x throughput |
| 2 | No Connection Pooling | 🟡 HIGH | MEDIUM | Connection Pool Singleton | 75% memory ↓ |
| 3 | Unbounded Query Results | 🟡 HIGH | HIGH | Cursor Streaming | OOM prevention |
| 4 | WebSocket Broadcast Inefficiency | 🟡 MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Concurrent Broadcast | 100x latency ↓ |
| 5 | No API Rate Limiting | 🔴 CRITICAL | HIGH | SlowAPI Integration | DoS protection |
| 6 | Fixed Thread Pool Size | 🟢 LOW | MEDIUM | Dynamic Thread Count | 4x on high-core |
| 7 | Startup Health Check Polling | 🟢 LOW | LOW | Exponential Backoff | 5x faster startup |

## Key Findings

### ✅ Strengths
1. **Excellent Architecture**: Dual-database design (DuckDB for OLAP, SQLite for OLTP) is optimal
2. **Strong Performance Targets**: Well-defined benchmarks with <1ms inserts, <50ms queries
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: 61 async tests covering performance, integration, and E2E flows
4. **Production-Grade Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs and performance decorators
5. **Proper Configuration**: WAL mode, memory limits, thread pools, and indexing strategies

### ⚠️ Critical Issues
1. **Write Bottleneck**: Single-writer model limits throughput to ~10k/sec
2. **DoS Vulnerability**: No rate limiting exposes API to abuse
3. **Memory Risk**: Unbounded query results can cause OOM
4. **Connection Waste**: No pooling leads to 4GB memory per client
5. **Test Gaps**: Missing error handling, edge cases, and production-scale tests

## Optimization Roadmap

### Week 1: Critical Fixes (P0) - 6 days
1. Day 1: Implement API rate limiting with SlowAPI
2. Days 2-3: Add query result streaming
3. Days 4-6: Implement batched write queue

### Week 2: High Priority (P1) - 4 days
1. Days 1-3: Add connection pooling
2. Day 4: Optimize WebSocket broadcast

### Week 3: Polish (P2) - 1 day
1. Day 1: Dynamic thread count + exponential backoff

**Total Timeline:** 2-3 weeks for 10x performance improvement
