# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - Trading Strategy Evaluation

**Date**: 2025-10-29
**Evaluator**: Performance Evaluator Agent
**Status**: CRITICAL FAILURE

## VERDICT: NO WINNER - ALL STRATEGIES REJECTED

### Results Overview

| Strategy | Return | Win Rate | Trades | Status |
|----------|--------|----------|--------|---------|
| Strategy 1 (Simple Momentum) | -0.39% | 0% | 5 | FAILED |
| Strategy 2 (Simplified Momentum) | -0.96% | 0% | 10 | FAILED |
| Strategy 3 (Mean Reversion) | -5.45% | 0% | 79 | FAILED |

### Critical Issues

**ALL THREE STRATEGIES FAILED WITH 0% WIN RATE**

This indicates a fundamental software bug, not just poor strategy design.

### Root Cause

1. **Signal Generation Bug**: Logs show "Generated 0 signals" repeatedly
2. **Portfolio Handler Error**: `portfolio_handler.py` likely has signal execution bug
3. **Position Tracking Failure**: EXIT signals without corresponding ENTRY signals
4. **Wrong Risk Parameters**: 2% stop-loss too tight for market volatility

### Immediate Actions Required

**DO NOT DEPLOY ANY STRATEGY TO PRODUCTION**

1. Fix `src/backtesting/portfolio_handler.py` signal execution
2. Run diagnostic tests: `pytest tests/unit/test_signal_validation.py`
3. Widen stop-loss from 2% to 5%
4. Increase take-profit from 3% to 8%
5. Lower MACD threshold from 0.0005 to 0.0002
6. Remove mean reversion strategy (wrong for trending market)

### Timeline to Production

- **Week 1**: Bug fixes and diagnostic testing
- **Week 2**: Parameter optimization and re-testing
- **Week 3**: Walk-forward validation
- **Week 4**: Paper trading validation
- **Month 2**: Gradual production rollout (if successful)

### Full Report

See: `/mnt/c/Users/DaviCastroSamora/Documents/SamoraDC/RustAlgorithmTrading/docs/strategy_comparison/FINAL_COMPARISON.md`

### Recommendation

**REBUILD, DON'T DEPLOY**

The strategies require fundamental software fixes before any production consideration. Focus on:
1. Fixing signal generation bugs
2. Validating with proper unit tests
3. Re-testing with wider risk parameters
4. Implementing market regime detection

**CRITICAL**: Do not deploy to production until win rate >40% and positive returns achieved on out-of-sample data.
