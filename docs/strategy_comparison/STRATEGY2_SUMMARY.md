# Strategy 2 Test Summary - Simplified Momentum

## ✅ Test Complete

**Test Date**: 2025-10-29
**Strategy**: Simplified Momentum (No SMA, No Volume filters)
**Status**: SUCCESS - Generated more signals than current strategy

## Key Results

### Signal Generation
- **Total Signals**: 31 (16 entries, 15 exits)
- **Completed Trades**: 15
- **Current Strategy Baseline**: ~5 trades
- **Improvement**: 3x more trades generated ✅

### Performance Metrics
- **Total Return**: -25.71%
- **Win Rate**: 26.67%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: -0.38
- **Max Drawdown**: 36.09%
- **Profit Factor**: 0.42

### Trade Statistics
- **Winning Trades**: 4 (26.67%)
- **Losing Trades**: 11 (73.33%)
- **Average Win**: +4.73%
- **Average Loss**: -4.06%

## Analysis

### ✅ What Worked
1. **Signal Generation**: Removing SMA and volume filters successfully increased trade frequency
2. **Entry Detection**: Strategy found 16 entry opportunities across 5 symbols
3. **Exit Execution**: 15 of 16 entries had corresponding exits (position management working)

### ⚠️ Issues Identified
1. **Low Win Rate**: 26.67% is below target (expected >50%)
2. **Negative Returns**: -25.71% total return indicates poor signal quality
3. **Profit Factor**: 0.42 means losing more than winning

### 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The test confirms **over-simplification is NOT the issue**. The problem is likely:

1. **Signal Quality**: RSI 50 crossings alone are too noisy
2. **Market Conditions**: Recent 6-month period may have been challenging
3. **Parameter Tuning**: MACD histogram threshold (0.0005) may need adjustment

## Comparison with Current Strategy

| Metric | Current Strategy | Strategy 2 (Simplified) |
|--------|------------------|------------------------|
| Total Trades | ~5 | 15 |
| Signals Generated | Low | 31 |
| Win Rate | Unknown | 26.67% |
| Filtering Approach | Heavy (SMA + Volume) | Light (RSI + MACD only) |

**Conclusion**: Removing filters increases signals but doesn't solve the win rate problem.

## Next Steps

### Recommended Actions

1. **Strategy 1 Test**: Test with trend-following approach (buy strength, not weakness)
   - Use RSI > 70 for LONG (momentum following)
   - Use RSI < 30 for SHORT (momentum following)
   - Compare results with this test

2. **Parameter Optimization**:
   - Test different RSI thresholds (40/60 instead of 50)
   - Adjust MACD histogram threshold
   - Consider longer holding periods

3. **Market Regime Analysis**:
   - Analyze which market conditions generated winning vs losing trades
   - Consider adding trend filter back (but different implementation)
