## 🎓 Best Practices Codified

### Test Design Principles
1. **Fast**: Unit tests <100ms total
2. **Isolated**: No shared state between tests
3. **Repeatable**: Deterministic results every run
4. **Self-Validating**: Clear pass/fail criteria
5. **Timely**: Write tests with or before code (TDD)

### Financial Domain Specifics
1. **Fixed-Point Arithmetic**: Use `rust_decimal` for money
2. **Timestamp Precision**: Test timezone handling
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Audit trail validation
4. **Market Microstructure**: Validate exchange behavior matching

### Performance Testing
1. **Realistic Load**: Test with production-like data volumes
2. **Latency Distribution**: Track percentiles, not just averages
3. **Resource Limits**: Test memory/CPU bounds
4. **Concurrency**: Test thread safety and race conditions
