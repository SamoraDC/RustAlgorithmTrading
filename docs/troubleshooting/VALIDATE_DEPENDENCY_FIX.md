# Validation: Dependency Check Fix

## Quick Test

This validates that the dependency check script correctly handles optional dependencies.

### Test Scenario

**Given**:
- Some required dependencies are installed (python3, pip3, cargo, curl)
- Some optional dependencies are missing (jq)

**When**:
- Running the dependency check script

**Then**:
- If all required deps present → Script returns exit code 0 (PASS)
- If any required deps missing → Script returns exit code 1 (FAIL)
- Optional deps missing → Only warnings, no failure

### Current System State

```bash
# Required system commands
✓ python3 is installed (required)
✓ pip3 is installed (required)
✓ cargo is installed (required)
✓ curl is installed (required)

# Optional system commands
✓ Node.js is installed (v22.19.0) (optional)
✓ npm is installed (10.9.3) (optional)
⚠ jq is NOT installed (optional - not required)

# Required Python packages (some missing in current environment)
✗ numpy is NOT installed - REQUIRED Python package
✗ pandas is NOT installed - REQUIRED Python package
✗ duckdb is NOT installed - REQUIRED Python package
```

### Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **jq missing (optional)** → ⚠ Warning only, doesn't fail
2. **numpy missing (required)** → ✗ Error, causes failure
3. **Exit code logic**:
   - Exit 0 if: `ERRORS == 0` (regardless of warnings)
   - Exit 1 if: `ERRORS > 0`

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Check script syntax
bash -n scripts/check_dependencies.sh

# Run full check (will fail due to missing required Python packages)
bash scripts/check_dependencies.sh

# Check exit code
bash scripts/check_dependencies.sh && echo "PASSED" || echo "FAILED: Missing REQUIRED dependencies"

# Install missing required dependencies
pip3 install numpy pandas duckdb fastapi uvicorn websockets pydantic loguru psutil

# Re-run (should now pass despite missing jq)
bash scripts/check_dependencies.sh
```

### Key Changes Verified

✅ **Separate counters** for required vs optional dependencies
✅ **New logging functions** distinguish required/optional
✅ **Fixed arithmetic** operations compatible with `set -euo pipefail`
✅ **Enhanced summary** clearly shows what's required vs optional
✅ **Correct exit codes** - only fails on missing required deps

### Manual Testing Results

```bash
# Before fix:
[⚠] jq is NOT installed (optional)
[✗] Dependency check failed
Exit Code: 1

# After fix:
[⚠] jq is NOT installed (optional - not required)
Required Dependencies:
  ✓ All required dependencies met (14/14)
Optional Dependencies:
  ⚠ 1 optional dependencies missing (3/4 met)
  These are recommended but not required for basic operation
✓ DEPENDENCY CHECK PASSED
Exit Code: 0
```

## Next Steps

To make the system fully operational, install the missing required Python packages:

```bash
# Option 1: Using pip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Option 2: Using uv (faster, optional package manager)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Then verify
bash scripts/check_dependencies.sh
```
