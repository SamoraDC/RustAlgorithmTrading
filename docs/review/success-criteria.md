feat(risk-manager): Add circuit breaker for extreme losses

Implement system-wide circuit breaker that pauses trading when losses
exceed configured threshold within time window. Includes:

- Configurable loss threshold (% of capital)
- Time window for loss calculation (rolling window)
- Manual reset required after trip
- Comprehensive logging and alerting

Closes #42
```

## Conclusion

This project is successful when:
1. It demonstrates deep technical skills in systems programming
2. It shows production-ready architecture and practices
3. It honestly acknowledges limitations and constraints
4. It serves as a strong portfolio piece for job applications
5. It provides educational value to others learning trading systems

**Remember**: The goal is not to create a profitable trading system (though that would be a bonus), but to demonstrate the ability to build complex, production-grade systems with appropriate architecture, testing, documentation, and operational practices.
