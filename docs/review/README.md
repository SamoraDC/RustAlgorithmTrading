### 4. [Constraint Analysis](./constraint-analysis.md) (32 KB)
**Purpose**: Analyze free API constraints and propose practical workarounds

**Contents**:
- Alpaca Markets constraints analysis
- Polygon.io constraints analysis
- Latency constraints and strategy selection
- Documentation of limitations
- Constraint management principles
- Free API decision matrix

**Key Constraints**:
- **Alpaca**: 200 requests/minute, IEX data only (2-3% volume)
- **Polygon**: 5 requests/minute, 15-min delayed real-time
- **Latency**: 30-100ms vs institutional <1ms
- **Order Book**: Top-of-book only (no Level 2/3)

**Key Workarounds**:
1. **Intelligent rate limiting** with priority queuing
2. **Aggressive local caching** (Parquet format)
3. **Conservative slippage models** (2x buffer)
4. **Latency-appropriate strategies** (avoid sub-second strategies)
5. **Honest disclosure** of limitations in documentation

**Philosophy**: Build a system that works excellently within constraints rather than poorly beyond them.

   - Position limits MUST be enforced with 100% reliability
   - P&L calculations MUST be accurate to $0.01
   - Circuit breaker MUST function correctly
   - State MUST persist across crashes

2. **Data Quality Transparency**
   - IEX limitations MUST be documented prominently
   - Conservative slippage models MUST be applied
   - Cross-validation with alternative sources recommended
   - Backtest disclaimers MUST be clear

3. **Rate Limit Handling**
   - Token bucket rate limiter with priority queuing
   - Zero tolerance for HTTP 429 errors
   - WebSocket preference over REST polling
   - Batch operations where possible

4. **Testing Rigor**
   - Property-based testing for financial calculations
   - Chaos engineering tests for resilience
   - 100% coverage for critical risk checks
   - Integration tests for all component interactions

5. **Documentation Excellence**
   - README with 5-minute quickstart

### Architecture Approval Conditions

The architecture is **APPROVED** subject to implementing these **MUST-HAVE** items before development:

1. ✅ Formalize state machines (order lifecycle, signal approval)
2. ✅ Add data integrity checks (Parquet checksums)
3. ✅ Implement configuration validation
4. ✅ Add environment validation (prevent production trading)
5. ✅ Define error handling strategy

## Next Steps for Swarm Coordination

### For ARCHITECT Agent:
- Review architecture recommendations in detail
- Design component interfaces based on review feedback
- Create state machine diagrams for order/signal lifecycle
- Plan data integrity and validation layers

### For PLANNER Agent:
- Incorporate risk mitigation into project timeline
- Schedule Phase 1 security work before core development
- Allocate time for testing and documentation (30% of project)
- Plan for iterative review cycles

### For CODER Agent:
- Implement security guardrails first (Phase 1)
- Follow architecture patterns (typestate for state machines)
- Write tests BEFORE implementation (TDD)
- Use provided code examples as templates

### For TESTER Agent:
- Set up testing framework per success criteria
- Implement property-based tests for risk calculations
