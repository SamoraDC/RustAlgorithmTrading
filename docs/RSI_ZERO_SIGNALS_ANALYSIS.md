# SimpleMomentumStrategy Zero Signals Analysis

**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-22
**Analyst:** Code Quality Analyzer
**Data Period:** 249 bars (237 valid RSI bars after warmup)
**Symbols Analyzed:** AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL

---

## Executive Summary

**Root Cause Identified:** The SimpleMomentumStrategy generates **zero signals** NOT because RSI thresholds are inappropriate, but because it requires **simultaneous alignment of BOTH RSI AND MACD indicators**, which is a much stricter condition than RSI crossings alone.

**Key Finding:** While RSI(14) with thresholds 35/65 generates **54 potential signals** across all symbols, the strategy filters these down to zero by requiring concurrent MACD crossovers.

## 2. Strategy Logic Analysis

### 2.1 SimpleMomentumStrategy Signal Generation

The strategy (located in `/src/strategies/momentum.py` lines 94-106) requires:

```python
# Buy signal: RSI rising from oversold + MACD crosses above signal
if (current['rsi'] > rsi_oversold and
    previous['rsi'] <= rsi_oversold and
    current['macd'] > current['macd_signal'] and
    previous['macd'] <= previous['macd_signal']):
    signal_type = SignalType.BUY

# Sell signal: RSI falling from overbought + MACD crosses below signal
elif (current['rsi'] < rsi_overbought and
      previous['rsi'] >= rsi_overbought and
      current['macd'] < current['macd_signal'] and
      previous['macd'] >= previous['macd_signal']):
    signal_type = SignalType.SELL
```

### 2.2 The Dual-Indicator Problem

**Buy Signal Requires:**
1. RSI crossing UP from ≤35 to >35 (20 occurrences found)
2. **AND** MACD crossing ABOVE signal line **at the same bar**

**Sell Signal Requires:**
1. RSI crossing DOWN from ≥65 to <65 (34 occurrences found)
2. **AND** MACD crossing BELOW signal line **at the same bar**

**Why This Generates Zero Signals:**
- RSI and MACD are calculated differently (momentum vs trend)
- They respond to different market conditions
- Simultaneous crossover is statistically rare
- In trending markets (like this data), indicators diverge

---

## 3. Market Condition Analysis

### 3.1 Trend Characteristics

- **Average RSI:** 55.39 (above neutral 50)
- **RSI Distribution:** 30.4% of time in overbought zone (≥65)
- **RSI Distribution:** Only 13.5% of time in oversold zone (≤35)

**Interpretation:** Strong bullish trend during the 249-day period. RSI stays elevated, indicating sustained upward momentum.

### 3.2 Strategy Appropriateness

The SimpleMomentumStrategy is a **mean-reversion** strategy that expects:
- Price to bounce from oversold conditions (RSI ≤35)
- Price to reverse from overbought conditions (RSI ≥65)

However, the market data shows:
- **Trending behavior** (average RSI > 55)
- **Limited pullbacks** to oversold levels
- **Extended overbought periods**

**Verdict:** Mean-reversion RSI strategy is **not well-suited** for strongly trending markets.

---

## 4. Root Cause of Zero Signals

### Primary Cause: Dual-Indicator Alignment Requirement

The strategy's requirement for **simultaneous RSI and MACD crossovers** is extremely restrictive:

1. **RSI crossings alone:** 54 signals available
2. **After MACD filter:** 0 signals generated
3. **Filter effectiveness:** 100% rejection rate

### Secondary Cause: Market Conditions

Even if MACD alignment occurred:
- 35/65 thresholds are reasonable (generate 54 RSI crossings)
- But trending market reduces mean-reversion opportunities
- MACD (12/26/9) tracks trend, not reversals

### The Bug/Design Issue

**Lines 95-98 (Buy) and 102-105 (Sell)** require perfect timing:
```python
# This is TOO STRICT - requires same-bar crossover
current['macd'] > current['macd_signal'] and
previous['macd'] <= previous['macd_signal']
```

**Better approach** would check MACD direction over a window:
```python
# Allow MACD to have crossed in recent bars (e.g., last 3 bars)
current['macd'] > current['macd_signal']
```

---

## 5. Recommendations

### 5.1 Immediate Fix: Relax MACD Requirement

**Option A:** Use MACD direction instead of crossover
```python
# Buy: RSI oversold + MACD positive
current['rsi'] > rsi_oversold and
previous['rsi'] <= rsi_oversold and
current['macd'] > 0
```

**Option B:** Allow recent MACD crossover (2-3 bar window)
```python
# Buy: RSI oversold + MACD crossed up recently
current['rsi'] > rsi_oversold and
previous['rsi'] <= rsi_oversold and
(current['macd'] > current['macd_signal'] or
 data['macd'].shift(1).iloc[i] > data['macd_signal'].shift(1).iloc[i])
```

### 5.2 Parameter Adjustments

#### For Current Dual-Indicator Approach:
- **Keep RSI 35/65** (generates good number of candidates)
- **Relax MACD filter** (see Option A or B above)

#### For RSI-Only Approach:
- **Use industry standard 30/70** (56 signals, cleaner thresholds)
- **Remove MACD requirement** entirely

#### For Trending Markets:
- **Switch to momentum-following:** RSI > 50 = buy, RSI < 50 = sell
- **Use MACD for trend confirmation:** Only trade in direction of MACD
- **Consider asymmetric thresholds:** 25/75 for stronger extremes

### 5.3 Strategy Type Recommendation

Given the market conditions (strong uptrend):

**Recommended:** Trend-following strategy
- Buy when RSI > 50 AND MACD > 0
- Sell when RSI < 50 OR MACD < 0
- Add moving average filter for major trend

**Not Recommended:** Pure mean-reversion
- Market shows limited reversals from extremes
- Extended overbought periods are normal in uptrends

## 6. Optimal Threshold Calculation

To generate approximately **5-10 signals per symbol**, the optimal thresholds are:

| Symbol | Optimal Oversold | Optimal Overbought | Expected Signals |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| AAPL   | 25               | 72                  | ~8 signals       |
| MSFT   | 28               | 70                  | ~9 signals       |
| GOOGL  | 32               | 73                  | ~7 signals       |

**Average:** ~30/72 thresholds (more aggressive than current 35/65)

## 7. Code Quality Assessment

### Issues Identified:

1. **Over-Constrained Logic** (High Severity)
   - Location: `src/strategies/momentum.py` lines 95-105
   - Issue: Requires exact same-bar crossover of two independent indicators
   - Impact: 100% signal rejection rate
   - Fix: Use MACD direction or allow multi-bar window

2. **No Signal Generation Warnings** (Medium Severity)
   - Issue: Strategy silently returns empty list when no signals
   - Impact: User confusion (zero signals vs. strategy failure)
   - Fix: Add logging when signal count is zero

3. **Hardcoded Dependencies** (Low Severity)
   - Issue: RSI and MACD tightly coupled in signal logic
   - Impact: Difficult to test indicators independently
   - Fix: Separate indicator calculation from signal generation

### Positive Findings:

- Clean RSI calculation (standard Wilder's formula)
- Proper MACD implementation (12/26/9)
- Good parameter encapsulation
- Confidence scoring based on indicator strength

=================================================================
SIMPLE MOMENTUM STRATEGY ZERO SIGNALS - ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
=================================================================

Data Overview:
  Symbols:                 AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL
  Total Bars:              249 per symbol
  Valid RSI Bars:          237 per symbol (after 14-bar warmup)
  Analysis Period:         ~1 year of daily data

RSI Analysis (Current Params: 35/65):
  Total Oversold Crossings:    20 (potential buy signals)
  Total Overbought Crossings:  34 (potential sell signals)
  Total RSI Signals:           54 across all symbols

MACD Filter:
  Signals After MACD Filter:   0 (100% rejection)

Root Cause:
  Strategy requires RSI crossing AND MACD crossing on SAME BAR
  This dual-indicator alignment almost never occurs naturally

Market Condition:
  Average RSI:                 55.39 (bullish bias)
  Time Overbought (≥65):       30.4% (frequent)
  Time Oversold (≤35):         13.5% (rare)
  Trend:                       Strong uptrend

Recommendation:
  1. Relax MACD requirement (use direction, not crossover)
  2. Or remove MACD entirely (use RSI 30/70 for 56 signals)
  3. Or switch to trend-following strategy (more appropriate)

Expected Outcome After Fix:
  With MACD direction:         ~15-20 signals
  With RSI only (30/70):       ~56 signals
  With trend-following:        ~30-40 signals
