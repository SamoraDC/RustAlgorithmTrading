## Critical Path Items (MUST COMPLETE)

### Before Production Deployment

#### 1. Implement Slippage Estimator ⚠️ **CRITICAL**
**File:** `/mnt/c/Users/DaviCastroSamora/Documents/SamoraDC/RustAlgorithmTrading/rust/execution-engine/src/slippage.rs`

**Current State:**
```rust
pub fn estimate(&self, order: &Order) -> f64 {
    // TODO: Implement slippage estimation
    0.0  // Always returns 0
}
```

**Required Implementation:**
- Walk order book levels
- Calculate market impact
- Estimate average fill price
- Return slippage in basis points
- Handle insufficient liquidity

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours
**Impact:** **HIGH** - Affects execution quality monitoring
**Assigned To:** Execution Engine Team
**Deadline:** Before production deployment

---

#### 2. Add Metrics Export (Prometheus) ⚠️ **CRITICAL**
**Location:** Create new module `rust/common/src/metrics.rs`

**Required Metrics:**
- Order execution latency (histogram: P50, P95, P99)
- Order success/failure rates (counter)
- Risk check rejections by type (counter)
- WebSocket connection status (gauge)
- Rate limiter quota usage (gauge)
- Circuit breaker state (gauge)
- Daily P&L (gauge)
- Position count (gauge)

**Implementation:**
```rust
use prometheus::{
    Counter, Histogram, Gauge, Registry,
    HistogramOpts, Opts,
};

pub struct Metrics {
    pub order_latency: Histogram,
    pub order_success: Counter,
    pub order_failure: Counter,
    pub risk_rejections: Counter,
    pub websocket_connected: Gauge,
    pub circuit_breaker_active: Gauge,
    // ... more metrics
}

impl Metrics {
    pub fn new(registry: &Registry) -> Self {
        // Initialize all metrics
        // Register with Prometheus registry
    }
}
```

**Estimated Effort:** 8-10 hours
**Impact:** **HIGH** - Essential for production monitoring
**Assigned To:** Platform Team
**Deadline:** Before production deployment

---

#### 3. Add Python Input Validation ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**
**File:** `/mnt/c/Users/DaviCastroSamora/Documents/SamoraDC/RustAlgorithmTrading/src/api/alpaca_client.py`

**Required Validation:**
```python
def place_market_order(self, symbol: str, qty: float, side: str, ...) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Place a market order with validation"""

    # Validate quantity
    if qty <= 0:
        raise ValueError(f"Quantity must be positive, got {qty}")

    # Validate symbol
    if not symbol or not symbol.strip():
        raise ValueError("Symbol cannot be empty")

    # Validate side
    if side.lower() not in ["buy", "sell"]:
        raise ValueError(f"Side must be 'buy' or 'sell', got '{side}'")

    # Validate time_in_force
    if time_in_force.lower() not in ["day", "gtc", "ioc", "fok"]:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid time_in_force: {time_in_force}")

    # Existing implementation...
```

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Impact:** **MEDIUM** - Prevents invalid orders
**Assigned To:** Python API Team
**Deadline:** Before production deployment

**Test Scenarios:**
- Sustained order throughput (100/sec for 1 hour)
- Burst order submission (1000/sec for 10 seconds)
- WebSocket reconnection under load
- Rate limiter behavior at limits
- Circuit breaker activation/recovery
- Memory usage over 24 hours

**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours
**Impact:** Capacity planning, performance validation
**Deadline:** Within 2 weeks of production

---

### 6. Enhance Logging
**Requirements:**
- Structured logging (JSON format)
- Correlation IDs for request tracing
- Sanitize sensitive data (API keys)
- Log levels: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
- Log rotation and retention

**Implementation:**
```rust
use tracing::{info, instrument};
use uuid::Uuid;

#[instrument(skip(config))]
pub async fn execute_order(order: Order, config: &Config) -> Result<Response> {
    let correlation_id = Uuid::new_v4();

    info!(
        correlation_id = %correlation_id,
        symbol = %order.symbol,
        side = ?order.side,
        quantity = order.quantity.0,
        "Executing order"
    );

    // ... implementation
}
```

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours
**Impact:** Better debugging, audit trail
**Deadline:** Within 2 weeks of production

---

## Nice to Have (Optional)
