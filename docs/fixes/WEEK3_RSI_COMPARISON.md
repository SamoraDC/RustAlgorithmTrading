# Week 3 RSI Zone Tightening - Before/After Comparison

## Overview
This document provides a side-by-side comparison of RSI zones before and after Week 3 fixes to reduce overtrading.

## RSI Zone Comparison

### LONG Entry Conditions

| Metric | Week 2 (Before) | Week 3 (After) | Change |
|--------|----------------|---------------|--------|
| **RSI Lower Bound** | 55 | 60 | +5 points |
| **RSI Upper Bound** | 85 | 80 | -5 points |
| **Zone Width** | 30 points | 20 points | -10 points (-33%) |
| **Center Point** | 70 | 70 | No change |
| **Signal Quality** | Weak-to-strong | Strong momentum | ✅ Improved |

**Week 2 Code:**
```python
rsi_long_cond = current['rsi'] > 55 and current['rsi'] < 85
```

**Week 3 Code:**
```python
# WEEK 3 FIX: Tightened RSI zones to reduce overtrading
# Week 2: 55-85 LONG zone → 69 trades (too many, 73% above target)
# Week 3: 60-80 LONG zone → Target 35-45 trades (tighter thresholds)
rsi_long_cond = current['rsi'] > 60 and current['rsi'] < 80  # Tightened bullish zone
```

### SHORT Entry Conditions

| Metric | Week 2 (Before) | Week 3 (After) | Change |
|--------|----------------|---------------|--------|
| **RSI Lower Bound** | 15 | 20 | +5 points |
| **RSI Upper Bound** | 45 | 40 | -5 points |
| **Zone Width** | 30 points | 20 points | -10 points (-33%) |
| **Center Point** | 30 | 30 | No change |
| **Signal Quality** | Weak-to-strong | Strong momentum | ✅ Improved |

**Week 2 Code:**
```python
rsi_short_cond = current['rsi'] < 45 and current['rsi'] > 15
```

**Week 3 Code:**
```python
# WEEK 3 FIX: Tightened RSI zones to reduce overtrading
# Week 2: 15-45 SHORT zone → 69 trades (too many, 73% above target)
# Week 3: 20-40 SHORT zone → Target 35-45 trades (tighter thresholds)
rsi_short_cond = current['rsi'] < 40 and current['rsi'] > 20  # Tightened bearish zone
```

## Expected Performance Impact

### Trade Count
| Metric | Week 2 | Week 3 Target | Improvement |
|--------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Total Trades** | 69 | 35-45 | -24 to -34 trades (-35% to -49%) |
| **Trades per Month** | ~6 | ~3-4 | -2 to -3 trades/month |
| **Overtrading** | 73% above target | Within target | ✅ Eliminated |

### Signal Quality Metrics
| Metric | Week 2 (Baseline) | Week 3 (Target) | Expected Improvement |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Win Rate** | 13.04% (9/69) | 20-25% | +7-12 pp |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | -0.54 | 0.0 to 0.5 | +0.5 to 1.0 |
| **Avg Win** | - | Improved | Stronger signals |
| **Avg Loss** | - | Similar | Same risk mgmt |

### Signal Distribution (Expected)

**Week 2 - Wide Zones (55-85 LONG, 15-45 SHORT):**
```
RSI Distribution of LONG Entries:
55-60: ██████ (weak signals, 20% of entries)
60-70: ████████████ (moderate, 40% of entries)
70-80: ████████████ (strong, 40% of entries)
80-85: ███ (overextended, filtered out)

RSI Distribution of SHORT Entries:
15-20: ███ (oversold bounce risk, filtered out)
20-30: ████████████ (strong, 40% of entries)
30-40: ████████████ (moderate, 40% of entries)
40-45: ██████ (weak signals, 20% of entries)
```

**Week 3 - Tight Zones (60-80 LONG, 20-40 SHORT):**
```
RSI Distribution of LONG Entries:
60-70: ████████████████ (moderate-strong, 50% of entries)
70-80: ████████████████ (strong momentum, 50% of entries)

RSI Distribution of SHORT Entries:
20-30: ████████████████ (strong momentum, 50% of entries)
30-40: ████████████████ (moderate-strong, 50% of entries)
```

## Technical Rationale

### Why 60-80 for LONG?

1. **Lower Bound (60):**
   - RSI 55-60: Transitional zone, weak conviction
   - RSI 60+: Confirmed bullish momentum
   - Filters marginal signals just above neutral (50)

2. **Upper Bound (80):**
   - RSI 80-85: Overextended, high reversal risk
   - RSI <80: Sustainable momentum zone
   - Prevents chasing overheated trends

3. **Center (70):**
   - Optimal momentum sweet spot
   - Neither weak (60) nor overextended (80)
   - Historical high-probability zone

### Why 20-40 for SHORT?

1. **Lower Bound (20):**
   - RSI 15-20: Oversold bounce risk
   - RSI 20+: Confirmed bearish momentum
   - Prevents catching falling knives

2. **Upper Bound (40):**
   - RSI 40-45: Transitional zone, weak conviction
   - RSI <40: Confirmed bearish pressure
   - Filters marginal signals just below neutral (50)

3. **Center (30):**
   - Optimal bearish momentum zone
   - Neither oversold (20) nor weak (40)
   - Historical high-probability zone

## Implementation Summary

### Files Modified
- **Strategy**: `/src/strategies/momentum.py` (Lines 361-365, 406)
- **Documentation**: `/docs/fixes/WEEK3_RSI_TIGHTENING.md`
- **Comparison**: `/docs/fixes/WEEK3_RSI_COMPARISON.md`

### Key Changes
1. ✅ LONG zone: 55-85 → 60-80 (33% reduction)
2. ✅ SHORT zone: 15-45 → 20-40 (33% reduction)
3. ✅ Added comprehensive comments explaining rationale
4. ✅ Updated class docstring with Week 3 zones
5. ✅ Documented expected improvements

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Run backtest with new zones
- [ ] Verify trade count: 35-45 (target range)
- [ ] Check win rate: >20% (vs 13.04% baseline)
- [ ] Validate Sharpe ratio: >0.0 (vs -0.54 baseline)
- [ ] Analyze RSI distribution at entries
- [ ] Compare P&L per trade vs Week 2

## Risk Analysis

### Potential Risks
1. **Too Few Trades**: Zones might be too tight, missing valid signals
   - **Mitigation**: 35-45 trade target still provides adequate sample size
   - **Threshold**: If <30 trades, consider widening to 58-82 (LONG), 18-42 (SHORT)

2. **Market Regime Change**: Zones optimized for 2024 data
   - **Mitigation**: Monitor performance across different market conditions
   - **Threshold**: If win rate drops below 15%, reassess zone widths

3. **Overfitting**: Fixed zones may not adapt to volatility
   - **Mitigation**: Phase 2 will implement configurable zones
   - **Future**: Dynamic zones based on VIX/ATR (Phase 3)

### Rollback Plan
If Week 3 results show:
- **Trade count <30**: Widen zones by 5 points (55-85, 15-45)
- **Win rate <15%**: Revert to Week 2 zones
- **Sharpe ratio <-0.7**: Investigate other issues (exits, position sizing)

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Week 3)
1. ✅ Implement RSI zone tightening
2. ⏳ Run backtest validation
3. ⏳ Analyze results vs targets
4. ⏳ Document findings

### Short-term (Week 4)
- Make RSI zones configurable parameters
- Run parameter sweep: 55-65 (lower), 75-85 (upper)
- Optimize zone widths via grid search

### Long-term (Phase 2)
- Dynamic RSI zones based on volatility (VIX/ATR)
- Adaptive thresholds for different market regimes
- Machine learning optimization of zone boundaries
