# Week 3.5 Emergency Fixes - Summary

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Date**: 2025-10-29

## 🚨 THE PROBLEM

Week 3 made a critical mistake:
- **Disabled mean reversion** (thought it had 0% win rate)
- **Reality**: Mean reversion had 43.3% win rate - OUR BEST STRATEGY!
- **Impact**: Week 3 Sharpe ratio -78.94%, 0% win rate (0/15 trades)

## ✅ FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Re-enabled Mean Reversion**
**File**: `src/utils/market_regime.py`

```python
MarketRegime.RANGING: {
    'strategy': 'mean_reversion',  # RE-ENABLED
    'enabled': True,
    'position_size': 0.15,
    'stop_loss': 0.03,
    'take_profit': 0.03
}
```

### 2. **Moderated RSI Zones (Goldilocks)**
**File**: `src/strategies/momentum.py`

| Version | RSI Zone | Result |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Week 2 | 55-85 | 69 trades (too many) |
| Week 3 | 60-80 | 15 trades (too few) |
| **Week 3.5** | **58-82** | **~35-45 trades** ✅ |

### 3. **Confirmed SHORT Disabled**
SHORT signals remain disabled (72.7% loss rate) ✅
