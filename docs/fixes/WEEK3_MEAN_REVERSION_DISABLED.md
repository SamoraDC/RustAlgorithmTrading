# Week 3 Priority 1: Mean Reversion Strategy Disabled

## Executive Summary
Mean reversion strategy has been **DISABLED** in the RANGING market regime following catastrophic Week 2 backtest results.

## Week 2 Backtest Results (Critical Failure)
- **Win Rate**: 0% (0 wins out of 63 trades)
- **Annualized Return**: -283%
- **Total Trades**: 63 (all losing trades)
- **Issue**: Strategy enters positions at Bollinger Band extremes, but market continues trending instead of reverting

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Market Regime Configuration (`src/utils/market_regime.py`)

**Lines 291-297 - RANGING Regime:**
```python
MarketRegime.RANGING: {
    'strategy': 'hold',  # Changed from 'mean_reversion'
    'direction': 'neutral',
    'stop_loss': 0.03,
    'position_size': 0.0,  # No position - mean reversion disabled
    'enabled': False  # DISABLED: Strategy enters at BB extremes but market continues trending
}
```

### 2. Logging Update (Lines 243-249)
Updated ranging regime detection logging to reflect disabled status:
```python
# Special logging for ranging regime (mean reversion DISABLED - Week 2 failure)
if current_regime in [MarketRegime.RANGING, MarketRegime.VOLATILE_RANGING]:
    logger.info(
        f"ðŸ“Š RANGING MARKET DETECTED - Mean reversion strategy DISABLED (Week 2: 0% win rate, -283% return) | "
        f"Strategy: {strategy_config['strategy']} | "
        f"Position size: {strategy_config['position_size']*100:.0f}%"
    )
```

### 3. Test Updates (`tests/unit/test_market_regime.py`)

**Lines 267-276:**
```python
def test_ranging_strategy(self):
    """Test strategy config for ranging market - DISABLED after Week 2 failure"""
    config = select_strategy_for_regime(MarketRegime.RANGING)

    # Mean reversion disabled due to Week 2 backtest: 0% win rate, -283% annual return
    assert config['strategy'] == 'hold'
    assert config['direction'] == 'neutral'
    assert config['enabled'] is False
    assert config['position_size'] == 0.0  # No position
    assert config['stop_loss'] == 0.03
```

## Expected Impact

### Performance Improvements
1. **Eliminate Major Loss Source**: Remove -283% annualized loss
2. **Reduce Total Trades**: Remove 63 consecutive losing trades
3. **Improve Win Rate**: Eliminate 0% win rate strategy
4. **Reduce Max Drawdown**: Prevent deep losses from false reversions

### Risk Reduction
- No more entries at Bollinger Band extremes during ranging markets
- Avoid false mean reversion signals when market continues trending
- Reduce exposure during unclear market conditions

## Root Cause Analysis

### Strategy Flaw
The mean reversion strategy assumes price will revert to the mean when reaching Bollinger Band extremes. However:
- **False Signal**: BB extremes during ranging markets often precede trend continuation
- **Timing Issue**: Entry signals too early before actual reversion
- **Market Context**: Strategy doesn't account for broader trend context

### Why It Failed (0% Win Rate)
1. Enters long at lower BB â†’ Market continues down
2. Enters short at upper BB â†’ Market continues up
3. Stop losses triggered consistently
4. No winning trades in 63 attempts

## Future Considerations

### Potential Fixes (Not Implemented Yet)
1. **Add Trend Filter**: Only trade mean reversion in confirmed ranging markets
2. **Improve Entry Timing**: Wait for confirmation of reversion before entry
3. **Stricter BB Conditions**: Require multiple touches or divergence signals
4. **Volume Confirmation**: Require decreasing volume at extremes
5. **Market Context**: Check broader timeframe for trend direction

### Recommendation
**DO NOT RE-ENABLE** mean reversion strategy without:
- Comprehensive redesign
- Additional confirmation signals
- Extensive backtesting showing positive win rate
- Risk management improvements

## Coordination
- Pre-task hook: `task-1761758141294-7ditajqe7`
- Post-edit hook: Memory key `swarm/week3/disable_mean_reversion`
- Post-task hook: Task ID `disable_mean_reversion_week3`

## Next Steps (Week 3 Remaining Priorities)
1. âœ… **Priority 1 COMPLETE**: Mean reversion disabled
2. **Priority 2**: Fix exit signal logic (strategy2 28% vs strategy3 4.8% win rate)
3. **Priority 3**: Reduce trading frequency (overtrading issues)
4. **Priority 4**: Position sizing validation
