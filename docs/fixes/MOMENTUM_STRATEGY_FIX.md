# Momentum Strategy Fix - Comprehensive Risk Management Implementation

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Target**: Fix 0% win rate → >40% win rate

## Problem Summary

The original momentum strategy had a 0% win rate due to several critical issues:

1. **Poor RSI thresholds** (40/60) - Too narrow, missing real opportunities
2. **No EXIT signals** - Only entry signals, positions never closed properly
3. **No stop-loss** - Unlimited downside risk
4. **No take-profit** - Winners never locked in
5. **Excessive position sizing** (95%) - Catastrophic risk per trade
6. **Short-selling bias** - Unbalanced signal generation

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. RSI Threshold Optimization ✅
**Before**: `rsi_oversold=40, rsi_overbought=60`
**After**: `rsi_oversold=30, rsi_overbought=70`

**Impact**:
- Wider thresholds capture true oversold/overbought conditions
- Reduces false signals in choppy markets
- Aligns with standard technical analysis practices

### 2. EXIT Signal Generation ✅
**Implementation**: Three-tier exit strategy

```python
# Priority 1: Risk Management Exits
if pnl_pct <= -stop_loss_pct:  # Stop-loss
    signal_type = SignalType.EXIT
elif pnl_pct >= take_profit_pct:  # Take-profit
    signal_type = SignalType.EXIT

# Priority 2: Technical Exits (momentum reversal)
if position_type == 'long':
    if rsi > rsi_overbought and macd_cross_down:
        signal_type = SignalType.EXIT
elif position_type == 'short':
    if rsi < rsi_oversold and macd_cross_up:
        signal_type = SignalType.EXIT
```

**Impact**:
- Guarantees positions are closed
- Prevents unlimited losses
- Captures technical reversals
- Locks in profits systematically

### 3. Stop-Loss Logic ✅
**Parameter**: `stop_loss_pct = 0.02` (2%)

**Implementation**:
```python
# Long position
pnl_pct = (current_price - entry_price) / entry_price
if pnl_pct <= -0.02:  # -2% loss
    EXIT with reason='stop_loss'

# Short position
pnl_pct = (entry_price - current_price) / entry_price
if pnl_pct <= -0.02:  # -2% loss
    EXIT with reason='stop_loss'
```

**Impact**:
- Limits maximum loss per trade to 2%
- Protects capital during adverse moves
- Prevents catastrophic losses

### 4. Take-Profit Logic ✅
**Parameter**: `take_profit_pct = 0.03` (3%)

**Reward:Risk Ratio**: 3% / 2% = **1.5:1**

**Implementation**:
```python
if pnl_pct >= 0.03:  # +3% profit
    EXIT with reason='take_profit'
```

**Impact**:
- Locks in winners systematically
- 1.5:1 reward:risk ensures profitability with >40% win rate
- Prevents "giving back" profits

### 5. Position Sizing Reduction ✅
**Before**: `position_size = 0.95` (95%)
**After**: `position_size = 0.15` (15%)

**Implementation**:
```python
def calculate_position_size(self, signal, account_value):
    position_value = account_value * 0.15  # 15% per trade
    shares = position_value / signal.price
    shares *= signal.confidence  # Scale by confidence
    return round(shares, 2)
```

**Impact**:
- Reduces catastrophic risk exposure
- Allows diversification across 6-7 positions
- Better risk management per the Kelly Criterion

### 6. Position Tracking System ✅
**New Feature**: Complete position lifecycle management

```python
self.active_positions = {
    'SYMBOL': {
        'entry_price': float,
        'entry_time': datetime,
        'type': 'long' | 'short'
    }
}
```

**Unrealized P&L Tracking**:
```python
def get_unrealized_pnl(self, symbol, current_price):
    """Calculate real-time P&L for active positions"""
    if position_type == 'long':
        return (current_price - entry_price) / entry_price
    else:  # short
        return (entry_price - current_price) / entry_price
```

**Impact**:
- Real-time P&L monitoring
- Accurate exit signal generation
- Better risk management decisions

### 7. Signal Balance ✅
**Fix**: Symmetric entry conditions

```python
# LONG entry: RSI recovery from oversold + MACD bullish
if (rsi > 30 and prev_rsi <= 30 and macd > macd_signal):
    signal_type = SignalType.LONG

# SHORT entry: RSI drop from overbought + MACD bearish
elif (rsi < 70 and prev_rsi >= 70 and macd < macd_signal):
    signal_type = SignalType.SHORT
```

**Impact**:
- Balanced LONG/SHORT opportunities
- No directional bias
- Captures both bullish and bearish momentum

## Performance Expectations
