# Race Condition Fix Implementation

**Author:** Coder Agent (Hive Mind)
**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Status:** Implemented
**Priority:** CRITICAL

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented a race condition fix to prevent cash overdraft when multiple orders are generated in the same bar before any fills are processed. The solution uses a reserved cash tracking mechanism to ensure available cash is accurately calculated across all order generations within a single bar.

---

## Problem Statement

### Race Condition Scenario

When multiple trading signals are generated in the same bar:

1. **Signal 1 arrives** → Portfolio handler generates BUY order for $5,000
2. **Signal 2 arrives** → Portfolio handler generates BUY order for $5,000
3. **Signal 3 arrives** → Portfolio handler generates BUY order for $5,000

With only $10,000 total cash, all three orders would be generated because each checked against the same $10,000 balance. When fills are processed, the total cost of $15,000 exceeds available cash, causing negative cash balance.

### Root Cause

- Cash was only updated **AFTER** fills were processed
- Multiple order generations in the same bar saw the same cash balance
- No mechanism to track "pending" cash commitments
- Race condition between order generation and fill processing

---

## Solution Architecture

### Reserved Cash Tracking

Implemented a reservation system that tracks committed cash for pending orders:

```python
# In PortfolioHandler.__init__
self.reserved_cash: float = 0.0  # Track reserved cash for pending orders
```

### Order Generation Flow

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   GENERATE_ORDERS                           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                             │
│  1. Calculate available cash:                               │
│     available_cash = portfolio.cash - reserved_cash         │
│                                                             │
│  2. For BUY orders:                                         │
│     a. Estimate total cost (position + commission + slip)   │
│     b. Check: total_cost <= available_cash ?                │
│        YES → Reserve cash, create order                      │
│        NO  → Calculate max affordable quantity               │
│               Reserve adjusted amount, create order          │
│                                                             │
│  3. Update reserved_cash += total_estimated_cost            │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Bar Processing Flow

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  BACKTEST ENGINE LOOP                       │

│  1. Update market data (new bar)                            │
│  2. Generate market event                                   │
│  3. Process all events in queue:                            │
│     - Market event → Generate signals                       │
│     - Signal events → Generate orders (reserve cash)        │
│     - Order events → Execute fills (deduct actual cash)     │
│     - Fill events → Update portfolio                        │
│  4. Clear reserved cash for next bar                        │
│  5. Repeat                                                  │

## Implementation Details

### File: `/src/backtesting/portfolio_handler.py`

#### Change 1: Added Reserved Cash Tracking

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    initial_capital: float,
    position_sizer: Optional['PositionSizer'] = None,
    data_handler: Optional['HistoricalDataHandler'] = None,
):
    # ... existing initialization ...

    # RACE FIX: Track reserved cash for pending orders in the same bar
    self.reserved_cash: float = 0.0
```

#### Change 2: Updated Order Generation with Cash Reservation

```python
def generate_orders(self, signal: SignalEvent) -> List[OrderEvent]:
    # RACE FIX: Calculate available cash minus reserved cash
    available_cash = self.portfolio.cash - self.reserved_cash

    if available_cash < 0:
        logger.warning(f"Available cash is negative: ${available_cash:,.2f}")
        return orders

    # ... calculate target quantity ...

    # RACE FIX: For BUY orders, check if we have enough available cash
    if order_quantity > 0:  # BUY order
        # Calculate estimated cost (position + commission + slippage)
        position_cost = abs(order_quantity) * current_price
        estimated_commission = position_cost * 0.001  # 0.1%
        estimated_slippage = position_cost * 0.0005    # 0.05%
        total_estimated_cost = position_cost + estimated_commission + estimated_slippage

        # Check if we have enough available cash
        if total_estimated_cost > available_cash:
            # Calculate maximum affordable quantity
            max_affordable_value = available_cash / (1 + 0.001 + 0.0005)
            max_affordable_quantity = int(max_affordable_value / current_price)

            if max_affordable_quantity <= 0:
                logger.info(f"Insufficient available cash for {signal.symbol}")
                return orders

            # Adjust order quantity
            order_quantity = max_affordable_quantity
            # Recalculate costs with adjusted quantity
            position_cost = abs(order_quantity) * current_price
            estimated_commission = position_cost * 0.001
            estimated_slippage = position_cost * 0.0005
            total_estimated_cost = position_cost + estimated_commission + estimated_slippage

        # RACE FIX: Reserve cash for this pending order
        self.reserved_cash += total_estimated_cost
        logger.debug(f"Reserved ${total_estimated_cost:,.2f} for {signal.symbol}")

    # ... create and return order ...
```

#### Change 3: Added Clear Reserved Cash Method

```python
def clear_reserved_cash(self):
    """
    Clear reserved cash after all orders in a bar have been processed.

    This should be called by the engine after processing all fills for a bar
    to reset the reservation system for the next bar.
    """
    if self.reserved_cash > 0:
        logger.debug(f"Clearing reserved cash: ${self.reserved_cash:,.2f}")
        self.reserved_cash = 0.0
```

### File: `/src/backtesting/engine.py`

#### Change 4: Engine Clears Reserved Cash After Each Bar

```python
def run(self) -> Dict:
    while self.continue_backtest:
        # Update market data bars
        if self.data_handler.continue_backtest:
            self.data_handler.update_bars()
            # ... create market event ...
        else:
            self.continue_backtest = False

        # Process event queue for this bar
        while self.events:
            event = self.events.popleft()
            self._dispatch_event(event)
            self.events_processed += 1

        # RACE FIX: Clear reserved cash after all events in bar are processed
        # This resets the cash reservation system for the next bar
        self.portfolio_handler.clear_reserved_cash()

    # ... generate results ...
```

## Key Features

### 1. Accurate Cash Tracking

- **Available cash** = Portfolio cash - Reserved cash
- Orders only generated if affordable with current available cash
- Prevents over-commitment of capital

### 2. Order Sizing Adjustment

If an order exceeds available cash:
- Calculate maximum affordable quantity
- Adjust order size down to affordable amount
- Log the adjustment for transparency
- Reject order if even 1 share is unaffordable

### 3. Automatic Cleanup

- Reserved cash cleared after each bar's events are processed
- Fresh start for next bar's order generation
- No lingering reservations between bars

### 4. Comprehensive Logging

```python
# Debug level: Cash reservations
logger.debug(f"Reserved $X for symbol (total reserved: $Y, available: $Z)")

# Info level: Order adjustments
logger.info(f"Reducing order from X to Y shares due to cash constraint")

# Warning level: Insufficient cash
logger.warning(f"Available cash is negative: $X")
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests Needed

1. **Test Single Order Generation**
   - Verify reserved cash increases correctly
   - Verify order size calculation with reservation

2. **Test Multiple Orders in Same Bar**
   - Generate 3 orders that would exceed capital without reservation
   - Verify each order sees reduced available cash
   - Verify total orders don't exceed capital

3. **Test Reserved Cash Clearing**
   - Generate orders (reserve cash > 0)
   - Call clear_reserved_cash()
   - Verify reserved_cash = 0

4. **Test Order Adjustment**
   - Request order that exceeds available cash
   - Verify order size is reduced
   - Verify it still fits within budget

5. **Test Order Rejection**
   - Request order for very expensive stock
   - Available cash < 1 share cost
   - Verify order is rejected (empty list returned)

### Integration Tests Needed

1. **Test Full Bar Processing**
   - Generate multiple signals in one bar
   - Process all events
   - Verify cash never goes negative
   - Verify reserved cash cleared at end

2. **Test Multi-Bar Backtest**
   - Run backtest with multiple bars
   - Verify no negative cash across entire backtest
   - Verify final cash = initial - net positions - commissions

### Property-Based Tests

```python
@hypothesis.given(
    initial_cash=st.floats(min_value=1000, max_value=1000000),
    num_orders=st.integers(min_value=1, max_value=10),
    prices=st.lists(st.floats(min_value=1, max_value=1000), min_size=1, max_size=10)
)
def test_reserved_cash_prevents_overdraft(initial_cash, num_orders, prices):
    """Property: Reserved cash mechanism prevents cash from going negative."""
    handler = PortfolioHandler(initial_capital=initial_cash)

    for i in range(num_orders):
        signal = create_signal(symbol=f"SYM{i}", price=prices[i % len(prices)])
        orders = handler.generate_orders(signal)

        # Property: available cash should always be >= 0
        available = handler.portfolio.cash - handler.reserved_cash
        assert available >= 0, f"Available cash went negative: ${available}"
```

## Performance Impact

### Computational Overhead

- **Per order:** O(1) arithmetic operations (calculate available cash, reserve cash)
- **Per bar:** O(1) to clear reserved cash
- **Memory:** O(1) - single float variable

### Expected Impact

- **< 0.1%** performance overhead
- **Negligible** memory increase
- **Significant** correctness improvement

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Multiple Orders in Single Bar

**Scenario:** 5 signals arrive in same bar, each requesting 20% of capital (100% total)

**Handling:**
- Order 1: Uses 20% of cash, reserves it
- Order 2: Uses 20% of remaining 80%, reserves it
- Order 3: Uses 20% of remaining 60%, reserves it
- Order 4: Uses 20% of remaining 40%, reserves it
- Order 5: Uses 20% of remaining 20%, reserves it
- Total: ~67% of capital allocated (not 100%)

### 2. Expensive Stock

**Scenario:** Stock price > available cash

**Handling:**
- Calculate max_affordable_quantity = 0
- Return empty order list
- Log insufficient cash message

### 3. Near-Zero Cash

**Scenario:** available_cash < commission cost

**Handling:**
- All BUY orders rejected
- SELL orders still allowed (they increase cash)

### 4. Negative Available Cash

**Scenario:** reserved_cash > portfolio.cash (should never happen)

**Handling:**
- Log warning with details
- Return empty order list
- Prevents further overdraft

---

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Metrics to Track

1. **Reserved Cash Ratio**
   ```
   reserved_ratio = reserved_cash / portfolio.cash
   Alert if > 0.9 (90% of cash reserved)
   ```

2. **Order Adjustment Rate**
   ```
   adjustment_rate = adjusted_orders / total_orders
   Alert if > 0.3 (30% of orders adjusted)
   ```

3. **Order Rejection Rate**
   ```
   rejection_rate = rejected_orders / total_signals
   Alert if > 0.2 (20% of signals rejected)
   ```

### Log Patterns to Monitor

```bash
# Grep for issues
grep "Available cash is negative" logs/backtest.log
grep "Insufficient available cash" logs/backtest.log
grep "Reducing order" logs/backtest.log

# Count adjustments
grep -c "Reducing order" logs/backtest.log

# Count reservations
grep -c "Reserved $" logs/backtest.log
```

## Known Limitations

### 1. Estimation vs Actual Costs

**Issue:** Reserved cash uses estimated commission/slippage, actual may differ

**Impact:** Low - estimates are conservative (slightly over-reserve)

**Mitigation:** Actual fill validation in update_fill() still enforces hard constraints

### 2. Reserved Cash Not Persisted

**Issue:** Reserved cash resets between sessions

**Impact:** None - backtesting is single-session, live trading needs different approach

**Future Work:** Implement persistent reservations for live trading

### 3. No Partial Fill Handling

**Issue:** Full order quantity is reserved, but partial fills possible

**Impact:** Low - simulated execution uses full fills

**Future Work:** Track partial fills and adjust reservations accordingly

---

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: Advanced Reservation System

1. **Order Priority System**
   - Rank signals by strength
   - Allocate cash to highest priority orders first
   - Reject lower priority orders if insufficient cash

2. **Predictive Cash Management**
   - Forecast fills based on order book
   - Reserve cash for expected fills
   - Dynamically adjust reservations

3. **Multi-Bar Reservation**
   - Track orders pending across multiple bars
   - Reserve cash until fill or cancellation
   - More accurate for delayed fills

### Phase 3: Risk Management Integration

1. **Position Limits**
   - Max position size per symbol
   - Max total exposure
   - Sector concentration limits

2. **Dynamic Sizing**
   - Adjust based on volatility
   - Scale down in high-volatility periods
   - Increase in low-volatility periods
