  🎯 My Recommendation

  DO NOT DEPLOY ANY STRATEGY TO PRODUCTION

  Instead, follow this roadmap:

  Week 1: Fix Software Bugs

  - Debug portfolio_handler.py signal execution
  - Validate position tracking logic
  - Add comprehensive logging
  - Run full test suite

  Week 2: Optimize Parameters

  - Use walk-forward optimization
  - Test on out-of-sample data (2023-2024)
  - Validate with 200+ bars minimum
  - Require win rate >40% before proceeding

  Week 3: Paper Trading

  - Deploy to Alpaca paper trading
  - Run for 2 weeks minimum
  - Monitor daily performance
  - Validate risk management

  Week 4: Production (If Successful)

  - Start with 10% of capital
  - Gradual ramp to 100% over 4 weeks
  - Daily monitoring and adjustment
  - Emergency stop-loss at -5% total capital

  📈 Success Criteria (Before Production)

  Strategies must achieve on out-of-sample data:
  - ✅ Win rate >40%
  - ✅ Total return >10% annually
  - ✅ Sharpe ratio >0.5
  - ✅ Max drawdown <15%
  - ✅ 30-60 trades per year
  - ✅ Profit factor >1.3
